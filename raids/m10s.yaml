      At the end of the cast, Red Hot dashes towards each player in order, dealing high damage and leaving behind a persistent rectangular fire puddle that inflicts [s:burns] on any who enter. Each player must be a sufficient distance from Red Hot by the time he dashes to them (as indicated by the tether changing colour) or they take lethal damage.
      Each hit inflicts [s:fire-resistance-down-ii] until the last dash.
    tips:
      - As long as each dash is taken at the minimum distance required (i.e. until the tether is no longer purple), maintaining melee uptime for players not targeted by the mechanic is easily possible with [s:sprint].

      The two brothers jump to opposite corners of the arena and begin casting.
      Around one second before the end of the cast, they move in a telegraphed arc on their surfboards until they reach the indicated wave symbol, at which point they execute a mechanic. The type of mechanic executed depends on the specific wave icon.
      * Shiny part of the surfboard points up: [a:vertical-blast]/[a:vertical-plunge], a [ms:chariot] [t:tankbuster] on the closest target
      * Shiny part of the surfboard points middle: [a:re-entry-blast]/[a:re-entry-plunge], a [conal](ms:cone) 4-man stack on the closest player
      * Shiny part of the surfboard points down: [a:blasting-snap]/[a:plunging-snap], a [conal](ms:cone) spread on the 4 closest players
      All attacks inflict [s:magic-vulnerability-up]. All attacks executed by Red Hot leave behind fire puddles.
      The two brothers execute 4 of these moves in succession. The order is random on a per-boss basis (meaning the two bosses are not guaranteed to be executing the same mechanic every turn), but each of the three mechanics is guaranteed to show up once, with [a:blasting-snap]/[a:plunging-snap] always appearing twice.

    description: |
      A two-man tower spawns in the middle of the arena.
      When it resolves, both bosses become untargetable and the tower turns into a massive bubble ("Watery Grave") that captures the two players who soaked the tower and inflicts [s:watery-grave] on them, preventing movement and gapclosers while dealing constant damage. The Watery Grave must be reduced to 0 HP to break these players out and dispel their debuffs. If the two players are not broken out before their debuffs expire, wipes the party.
      If more than two players soak the tower, two players are picked at random out of all the soakees to be encaged by the Watery Grave.
      During this mini-phase, each boss will tether to a random player and execute [a:xtreme-wave]. Like [a:flame-floater], each tether must be extended a certain distance or the hit deals lethal damage. Red Hot's [a:xtreme-wave] does not leave behind a puddle, but intersecting it with Deep Blue's wave triggers [a:steam-burst].
      [a:xtreme-wave] can intersect the Watery Grave and this has a specific effect based on the boss from whom the tether originated:
      Deep Blue's [a:xtreme-wave] grants the Watery Grave a 10s [s:vulnerability-down].
      Red Hot's [a:xtreme-wave] deals damage to the Watery Grave equal to 15% of its maximum health and triggers [a:scathing-steam], a moderate raidwide.
    resolve: |
      Avoid hitting the Watery Grave with Deep Blue's [a:xtreme-wave], but hit the Watery Grave with every one of Red Hot's [a:xtreme-wave]s.
      Due to the Watery Grave's significantly inflated health pool, missing even a single Red Hot [a:xtreme-wave] is essentially guaranteed to result in an enrage.
    tips:
      - A two-minute window comes up during this mini-phase. Unless you accidentally cause [s:vulnerability-down] or you have deaths, aim to delay your one-minutes and two-minutes until this mini-phase ends, as you are likely to overkill the Watery Grave otherwise, resulting in your two-minutes being completely wasted.

      Inflicts the closest 4 players to Red Hot with either [s:xtreme-firesnaking] or [s:xtreme-watersnaking]. All other players are inflicted with the opposite debuff.
      Unlike [s:firesnaking] and [s:watersnaking], this debuff has no effect on which boss is able to target a given player. Instead, it's a debuff with a fixed duration. Players can cleanse the debuff by getting hit by an attack from the opposite boss ([s:xtreme-firesnaking] by Deep Blue, [s:xtreme-watersnaking] by Red Hot). Cleansing the debuff in this manner triggers [a:bailout], a moderate explosion that briefly inflicts [s:magic-vulnerability-up] on all nearby players.
      Failing to cleanse the debuff causes instant death.
      Both bosses repeat the [a:insane-air-initial] mechanic immediately after. Cleanses must take place during this mechanic. There's one difference compared to the original [a:insane-air-initial]: this time, while the order of the mechanics is still random on a per-boss basis, this time both bosses are guaranteed to use [a:vertical-plunge]/[a:vertical-blast] (the [t:tankbuster]) at the same time.
    resolve: |
      Decide on a cleanse order, such as HMR (healers, melees, rangeds). Each player starts on the boss that corresponds to their debuff (same colour). During each of the 3 non-tankbuster [a:insane-air-initial] sets, the corresponding two players swap light parties, joining the other light party for their mechanic. Tanks swap whenever the tankbuster happens.

      Moderate-sized explosion that deals little damage and inflicts [s:magic-vulnerability-up].
      Caused by a player with [s:xtreme-firesnaking] or [s:xtreme-watersnaking] getting hit by the opposite type of damage.
    mistakes:
      - The [s:magic-vulnerability-up] is what forces a player to "swap" bosses (resolve their [s:xtreme-firesnaking]/[s:xtreme-watersnaking] near the opposite boss). It also means that a player death is likely to cascade into a wipe, as it may cause one of the [a:plunging-snap]/[a:blasting-snap] cones to shoot at the opposite side, causing multiple explosions to be on top of each other, which is lethal.

      Red Hot enters the arena.
      From now on, both bosses are targetable at the same time. Each boss has the [s:brotherly-love] buff, which prevents the HP of either from being reduced below 1 HP until the other has reached 1 HP.
      All of Red Hot's attacks leave behind a persistent fire puddle in the shape of that AoE. These puddles persist until the next [a:divers-dare].
      Deep Blue's attacks trigger [a:steam-burst] when they intersect with an attack or puddle from Red Hot.
