  A variety encounter, as [boss] eats souls for breakfast, then adopts their aspects. While most of the fight revolves around simple AoE avoidance and stack/spread mechanics,
  [boss] executes a dangerous [m:mech.limit] mechanic in the middle of the fight, one of the most lethal mechanics a first floor has ever had.

    description: |
      Odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7) appear above the orbs, while even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) appear above four random players. This is a [m:mech.limit] mechanic with *four turns*. After the cast resolves, the boss becomes untargetable and the first turn begins. In each turn the following three mechanics happen simultaneously:
      [a:shock]: [a:shock:d]
      [a:firemeld]: [a:firemeld:d]
      [a:icemeld]: Before each turn, a blue marker appears above a random unnumbered party member. These party members will receive an enormous [ms:chariot] [t:AoE] that inflicts [s:magic-vuln]. Unlike [a:shock]'s and [a:firemeld]'s vulnerabilities, however, [a:icemeld]'s vulnerability lasts for the duration of the entire mechanic. This means that even after their [a:icemeld] is resolved, these players cannot soak towers at any point. All towers must be soaked by numbered players two turns before or after their respective [a:firemeld] dash.
      **Order** (tower soaks): 6-8-2-4. An easy way to remember this is that, if you're 2 or 4, your first mechanic is a [a:firemeld]. If you're a 6 or 8, your first mechanic is a tower soak. Afterwards, your other responsibility resolves exactly two turns later.
      Note that, after the last tower is resolved, the boss immediately starts casting [a:two-minds], which essentially serves as a [t:body check] and also requires players to get into their assigned [t:protean] or partner positions quickly.

          First, identify the *1* orb, then find whether the *3* orb is clockwise or counter-clockwise to the *1* orb. This will determine the way you rotate during the mechanic.
          Anyone with a number immediately heads opposite the *1* orb (toward the *5* orb, but not too close to the wall). Anyone without a number stays near the *1* orb. One of those players will randomly receive an [a:icemeld] marker. They will plant at the wall behind the *1* orb while the remaining three non-numbered players will rotate in the direction of the *3* orb. The next player who receives a blue marker will then plant at the wall behind the *3* orb, and so on. After their [a:icemeld] resolves, these players will merge back with the numbered players on the opposite side.
          For players with numbers: for the first iteration, the *6* player waits outside where the tower will spawn, then heads inside the tower while the *2* player plants *in-between* the wall of the *5* orb and the *7* orb, or in other words: plant yourself an *eighth* of a rotation in the direction found at the start of the mechanic. Wait for all mechanics to resolve, then all players rotate in the corresponding direction and repeat until the mechanic is concluded.
          The benefit of this strategy is that it allows for maximum uptime on abilities like [a:meditate] or [a:soulsow]. As long as you remember which direction to rotate, focusing on just your own duty during the mechanic makes it easily digestible.

          First, identify the *1* and *3* orbs. The non-numbered players will wait there while the numbered players go opposite, between the *5* and *7* orbs (but closer to the center than the wall). Whoever receives the first [a:icemeld] marker stays between *1* and *3*; the other players all move between *5* and *7*. Whoever receives the second [a:icemeld] waits until the first one has resolved, then swaps places with that player.
          For the numbered players, towers resolve as normal (*6* and *8* just head into whichever towers first appear). The [a:firemeld] players (*2* and *4*) treat this mechanic exactly the same as the [a:icemeld] players, but on the opposite side; so *2* will plant at the edge between the *5* and *7* orbs, then swap with *4* once their [a:firemeld] resolves.
          After the first two turns, the party switches sides: the numbered players will now go to the [a:icemeld] side (which will now have no orbs left) and the [a:icemeld]s will resolve their mechanic where the [a:firemeld]s previously resolved theirs, and vice-versa.
          The benefit of this strategy is that, aside from finding the initial positions, you do not need to remember the direction of rotation at all. The downside is that there is a far greater amount of movement than in Oppo, which may cause problems for abilities that accrue resources and require you to stand still like [a:meditate] or [a:soulsow].

    description: |
      This is another [m:mech.limit] mechanic similar to [a:lc1], though this one is far simpler. Four numbers from 1-4 are placed above four players. These players will receive [a:icemeld]s in that order, which will likely kill any other players hit due to the [s:magic-vuln].
      Between the second and third [a:icemeld]s [boss] will use either [a:front-firestrikes] or [a:rear-firestrikes]. Similar to [a:firemeld], this will target a random non-[a:icemeld] player and jump on them, inflicting enormous damage that falls off with distance and can also be shared. Afterwards, [boss] will cleave everything either in front or behind him, depending on the which ability was used.
      Unlike [a:lc1], these [a:icemeld] targets are not random. The *farthest* player from [boss] receives *1*, the second-farthest *2*, and so on. This allows you to give the same players the same role each time and use identical movement each pull.
    resolve: |
      As the [a:icemeld]s come out quite fast, it is recommended to place the *1* and *2* players both on the outside of the arena, then swap *3* for *1* once *1* resolves, and *4* for *2* once *2* resolves.
      The rest of the party must stack outside of [a:icemeld] range and pay attention to [boss]'s cast: either [a:front-firestrikes] or [a:rear-firestrikes]. At the end of the cast (which happens between the resolution of the *2* and *3* [a:icemeld]s), [boss] will dash towards a random non-numbered player and hit them with [a:pyremeld]. Like [a:firemeld], [a:pyremeld] is a proximity-based attack, dealing more damage the closer the targeted player is to [boss]'s initial position, but unlike [a:firemeld] it is also a *stack*.
      Note that the distance from the center of the arena to the far edge of the wall is insufficient to survive [a:pyremeld] without mitigation, so the solution is to either drag [boss] slightly towards the [a:icemeld] side at the start of the mechanic to increase the distance of the dash, or to heavily mitigate [a:pyremeld].
      After [a:pyremeld], the boss *briefly* turns towards whichever player he jumped on, then casts [a:swinging-kick-cast-front] (front) or [a:swinging-kick-cast-rear] (rear) based on whichever Firestrikes was cast at the beginning. Note that during this cast you can no longer turn [boss]. This means that, for [a:front-firestrikes] all stacking players should briefly move in front of [boss] to face him into the outside of the arena, while for [a:rear-firestrikes] all players should move back towards the center of the arena to make [boss] face into the arena. Either way, his Swinging Kick will now hit the outside of the arena, leaving the [a:icemeld] players safe.

          This strategy places the [a:icemeld] on the north side of the arena and the party stack on the south side. The two most important slides in the diagram are slides **4**, where the tank drags the boss northward to significantly reduce the damage dealt by [a:pyremeld], and slide **9**, where all jumped-on players position themselves in front of [boss] to bait [a:swinging-kick-cast-front] forward. Note that [boss] cast [a:front-firestrikes] in this diagram; if [boss] had cast [a:rear-firestrikes] instead, the jumped-on players would instead position themselves behind the boss after [a:pyremeld] to turn the boss toward the center of the arena.

    description: |
      [boss] dashes to a non-[a:icemeld] target and blows them up in a fire tornado. Happens during [a:lc2]. It deals more damage the *less* distance [boss] dashes.
      This attack is almost the same as [a:firemeld], but there are a few differences. For one, [a:pyremeld] is a 4-person stack. Not stacking drastically increases the damage dealt. The actual damage and falloff numbers are also different, maxing out at less distance than [a:firemeld].
      [a:pyremeld] has a damage fall-off of about 12,500 damage per yalm, maxing out at 22y. If the boss is kept centered, the maximum achievable distance to the boss if one is all the way at the wall is about 19y, which still deals about 100,000 damage.
    resolve: |
      The targeted player should be as far away from [boss]'s initial position as possible. As it is not possible to determine who out of the 4 non-[a:icemeld] players is targeted, all of them should go to the wall, treating it as if they were being targeted. As the distance from the arena's center to the wall is insufficient, the main tank should move [boss] slightly in the direction of the designated [a:icemeld] positions to allow the party to stack at least 22y away from the boss. Be aware that you shouldn't be *all* the way at the wall, to allow you to bait the subsequent [a:swinging-kick-cast-front] into the wall if [boss] used [a:front-firestrikes] before.
      **Do not use tank invulnerabilities to "cheese" this mechanic** by placing only the tanks at the wall and keep everyone else center. There is no way to ensure that a tank is targeted, so if they aren't, all center players will die.

      Same mechanic as the previous [a:rockbreaker-1], except [boss] doesn't use [a:rear-comb] or [a:front-comb] but instead casts [a:dualspell].
      This does mean that you *must* dodge the lines' [ms:chariot] [t:AoE]s at or close to your [t:protean] position (or your partner's position if the boss casts fire and ice). While this initially sounds horrible, bear in mind that you don't have to worry about [a:roundhouse-in], [a:roundhouse-out], or [a:swinging-kick-front], and that [a:dualspell] resolves *after* all the lines have already resolved, making this arguably the easier combination of mechanics than the first [a:rockbreaker-1].
