      The chains can be broken through distance, but the distance required is relative to the starting distance between the two partners at the time that [s:missing-link] is applied. If both players are standing on top of each other at that point, the required distance to break the tether is approximately the full diameter of the miniature arena.

    description: |
      Heavy raidwide that initiates a major shape-based mechanic.
      12 polyhedra spawn in a 4x3 grid pattern within the arena: 4 red tetrahedra, 4 yellow cubes, and 4 blue icosahedra. After some time, each tetrahedron and cube attempts to *tether* itself to a neighbouring icosahedron. If successful, the shapes merge, wiping the raid. Players can prevent this by *intercepting* the tether before it appears. This causes the shape to tether itself to the player and merge with them instead, dealing medium damage to that player.
      Additionally, each player is assigned either [s:alpha] or [s:beta], shows a PlayStation icon above their head, and is tethered to another player ([s:shackled-together]), causing a wipe if the pair separates.
      The arrangement of the shapes is pseudo-random, but there are some guarantees:
      * There will never be more than 1 icosahedron per column.
      * Each icosahedron will be surrounded by at least 1 cube and 1 tetrahedron (but may be surrounded by more).
    resolve: |
      As there are 4 icosahedra and 4 pairs of players, each shackled pair should choose one icosahedron to "protect". The challenge of this mechanic, then, lies in figuring out which tetrahedron and which cube will tether to your designated icosahedron, as you must stand directly between that shape and the icosahedron to intercept the tether, and you must do so *before* the tether appears.
      If your icosahedron appears in a corner, this is a simple task; there are only two shapes neighbouring the corners, so there is no ambiguity. However, any other icosahedron may have 2 or even 3 different options on which shapes it may choose to tether to. Despite this, there is no randomness to the linking; each link can be 100% deterministically determined by checking the other shapes that surround the icosahedron and checking the possible options from *their* perspective.
      For instance, if you're designated to intercept the link between an icosahedron and one of two surrounding cubes, you will likely find that one of the cubes is next to two icosahedra, but that the other cube is next to *only your icosahedron* and therefore has no other option than to tether to that one.
      Note that while you *can* "YOLO" the mechanic, it is **strongly recommended** to use a deterministic shape assignment for your players. The [s:alpha] and [s:beta] status effects and PlayStation icons help with this and have no mechanical effect whatsoever. Since each column spawns exactly one icosahedron, you may use the PlayStation markers to assign columns to pairs (e.g. [i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle] for columns 1–4), and the statuses to determine which player within the pair intercepts which shape (e.g. [s:alpha] for tetrahedron, [s:beta] for cube).

    trivia: >
      This ability is a reference to the classical elements earth, fire, air, and water. Notably, the mechanic itself uses Platonic solids (the collective name of the five convex, regular polyhedra) as stand-ins for these elements. Plato was a Greek philosopher who first associated each of these polyhedra with a particular element: fire with the tetrahedron, earth with the cube, air with the octahedron, and water with the icosahedron. With the notable absence of the octahedron, Plato's interpretation matches the colours and names of the polyhedra in the arena.

      While it is possible to "YOLO" this mechanic and just have players spread to an intercardinal relative to their tower that is closest to their initial spot while intercepting the tether, it is recommended to use a more deterministic strategy, for instance by using the [s:alpha] and [s:beta] markers to determine whether a player goes to the northmost or southmost spot to bait their cone within their column.
      If you're on the second or third column, make sure to stay close to the tower while baiting the cone to avoid getting clipped by a cone from the other side.

      Major mechanic.
      At the start of the cast, a grid appears on the arena. Additionally, 2 players (1 support and 1 DPS) are marked with a beacon. At the end of the cast, **one** of them explodes for massive damage that can be shared in addition to raidwide damage to every party member.
      After the cast, 4 players (2 supports and 2 DPS) are assigned [s:pyrefaction] and [s:caloric:1]; these players are marked with a giant fire beacon above their heads. The other 4 players are assigned [s:atmosfaction] and [s:caloric:2].
      [s:caloric]: During the entire mechanic, moving the length of the short side of two grid rectangles or moving the diagonal length of one grid rectangle adds one stack of [s:caloric] to that player. Reaching [s:caloric:5] wipes the party.
      [s:pyrefaction]: A partner stack that must be shared by one other player or the party wipes. This also adds another stack of [s:caloric] to the source players (but not to anyone stacking with them).
      [s:atmosfaction]: A chariot that knocks back everyone who is hit by it, causing a wipe due to the resulting rapid accumulation of [s:caloric].
    trivia: The caloric theory is a debunked scientic theory that posed that heat comes from a unique fluid called the *caloric* which flows from hot to cold.
    resolve: |
      Regardless of what your strategy for this mechanic overall is, the initial beacon players must stack with at least one other person. Note that, since only one of them actually gets the stack, they can stack with each other.
      After this, movement becomes severely limited. All [s:atmosfaction] players must share one [a:pyre-pulse], while all [s:pyrefaction] players must share 2 [Pyre Pulses](a:pyre-pulse). This means that all players receive [s:caloric:3] from those status effects alone, leaving them with only one single move for the entire mechanic.
      This does make it easy to think about the mechanic though. Basically, the rule is: if you haven't moved yet, your job is yet to come. If you *have* already moved, your job is done and you can sit back for the rest of the mechanic. It is out of your hands.
      To start with, the goal is to pair each [s:atmosfaction] player with one [s:pyrefaction] player, since [Pyrefactions](s:pyrefaction) can't stack with each other. Depending on the strategy you use, you may use either the [s:atmosfaction] players' one move here or the [s:pyrefaction] players'.
      Either way, once the first step of the mechanic is concluded and 2 more [Pyrefactions](s:pyrefaction) are assigned, the goal is to then pair the two players who now have nothing with the two players with [s:pyrefaction]. You have to do this away from the [s:atmosfaction] players as they will blow up at the same time.
      Once the mechanic is complete, **do not move until your stacks have disappeared.** After the last [a:pyre-pulse] it still takes several seconds for [s:caloric] stacks to expire.

      Everyone receives [ms:chariot] [m:spread] shortly after the [proximity AoEs](m:raidwide.proximity) resolve.
      If the exaflares spawn west/east, they'll travel straight across the arena. If they spawn north/south, they will travel through the arena diagonally.
    resolve: |
      To reduce the proximity damage to survivable levels, the party must stack in-between the exaflares on the cardinals that the [proximity AoEs](m:raidwide.proximity) *don't* spawn on.
      As everyone gets a [ms:chariot] [m:spread] right afterward, it is recommended to split your party into two light parties for this initial bit of movement. The generally accepted split is light party 1 on west and light party 2 on east, or all melees and tanks north and all ranged DPS and healers south. Afterwards, quickly move to spread positions along the edge where you stacked.
      If you use fixed positions for [a:geocentrism], you can use the same spread positions here.

      Tower-based major mechanic.
      [s:unstable-factor:2], 1× [s:astral-tilt] (20s), 1× [s:astral-tilt] (16s), 1× [s:umbral-tilt] (20s), 1× [s:umbral-tilt] (16s) on 4 random players
      [s:unstable-factor:1] on 2 other random players
      [s:stable-system] on everyone
      Then [a:pantheos] spawns a subsequent series of 2-person towers, which all must be soaked by the proper number of players:
      * Step 1: dark + light
      * Step 2: dark + light + light + dark
      * Step 3: dark + light + light + dark
      It is random whether the west side first spawns a dark tower or a light tower. The east side will always spawn the exact opposite towers as the west side.
      Soaking a tower while you have the same elemental tilt results in a wipe.
      After soaking a tower, one of the two soakers receives a corresponding tilt debuff, requiring them to soak a tower of the opposite polarity in the next step. The other soaker's tilt debuff (if they had one) falls off, allowing them to soak any tower.
      The goal of this mechanic is to properly soak all towers while also reducing everyone's [s:unstable-factor] stacks to zero. Failing to do results in a wipe. [s:unstable-factor] stacks can be reduced by merging with (i.e. standing close to) a player with less stacks (including zero). No merge will occur if either player has [s:stable-system]. All players initially start with this status effect to avoid accidentally merging at the start of the mechanic, but it quickly falls off.
      Reducing your number of stacks for the first time inflicts [s:critical-factor] and spawns a Forbidden Factor (slime). After all towers have been soaked, all 6 Forbidden Factors will tether to a random player before rushing toward them and executing [a:factor-in], an enormous Defamation-like explosion that inflicts lethal damage to anyone under the effect of [s:critical-factor]. The tethers can be passed.

      Hot Potato – The Mechanic.
      Similar to [a:caloric-theory], but while [a:caloric-theory] focused on limited movement to properly resolve stacks/spreads, [a:caloric-theory-2] is instead a much simpler "hot potato" type mechanic. One person is inflicted with [s:entropification:8], which "pulses" periodically, creating a telegraphed [chariot AoE](m:aoe.baitable) underneath the player that must be moved out of. Each of these pulses reduces the stacks of the status effect by one, until it disappears completely.
      [s:entropification:8] can be passed to another player. This is necessary because movement is still limited, so no one player has enough movement to move out of every one of the [chariot AoEs](m:aoe.baitable).
      Additionally, at the start of the mechanic 7 players receive a green marker above their heads and 1 player receives a red marker. These are all [ms:chariot] [m:spread], but all green marker players start with [s:caloric:2] while the red marker player starts with [s:caloric:3]. Only green marker players can be selected for [s:entropification:8].
      Everyone also receives [s:atmosfaction], which releases a [ms:chariot] [m:spread] at the end of the mechanic.
    resolve: |
      Preposition in a circle (or hexagon), with the red marker player in the center, as they can only move once. As a hexagon only has six corners, one of the green marker players should position close to another player on the outside of the hexagon.
      Whoever receives [s:entropification:8] waits until the first AoE appears below their feet, then moves clockwise to the next player. Both players wait until the next AoE appears, then the player who *passed* the status effect moves outside the hexagon, while the player who was passed *to* moves to the next player clockwise. Remember to take a detour to include the player who had to position on the outside of the hexagon initially.
      Note that, although the red marker player in the center can move once, which might suggest you should pass to them last, this is a red herring – you *should never* pass [s:entropification] to the red marker player, as this will only complicate the mechanic for no reason, as you'd have to worry about the green marker player on the outside of the hexagon being the second-to-last person with [s:entropification], as they're too far away to pass to the center player.
      Instead, just ignore the red marker player entirely and have the last player on the edge of the hexagon take two pulses instead of just one. After all, the only reason you needed to pass [s:entropification] after each pulse is to ensure the next pulse can get to where it needs to be, but once you're on the last player there *is* no next pulse.

    trivia: |
      *Entropy* is a complicated scientific concept that, in general, describes the amount of unusable energy in a system. Anytime an energy transaction happens, a part of that energy (or heat) disperses and is irreversibly "lost" as the system can no longer use it for future energy transactions.
      Consider <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/en/File:Newtons_cradle_animation_book_2.gif">Newton's cradle</a>: in theory all the momentum is conserved, so the balls should keep swinging forever. In practice they stop completely after some time, because a part of that kinetic energy disperses during each swing until there is nothing left.
      In any system (including the universe itself) entropy is constantly increasing. The end result is the <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Heat_death_of_the_universe">heat death of the universe</a>, a state wherein all energy in the universe has completely dispersed. There is no single concentrated cluster of energy anywhere; every single cubic centimeter in the entire universe has the exact same amount of energy in it. In this state stars can no longer exist, so it is also the end of life as we know it.
      This mechanic demonstrates this concept quite well; at the start of the mechanic entropy is extremely low as all 8 stacks of [s:entropification:8] are initially concentrated on one player, but each pulse irreversibly loses one stack until there is no heat left.

      Divide into supports/DPS groups like before.

Only *after* [a:ultima-ray] has gone off should you move along the safe spot to establish spread positions.
      Remember that [a:divine-excoriation] is a very small AoE. You don't need to use more than half of a "lane" for the spreads.

      The name refers to *ignoramus et ignorabimus*, a Latin maxim meaning "we do not know and will not know". In science this maxim is used to emphasize the idea that there are some things science will never be able to explain, regardless of the amount of research conducted. For [boss], however, you might interpret it a different way: Athena doesn't understand (and never will understand) why the party opposes her in creating her perfect paradise, hence why she gives up on trying to show them her new world and annihilates them instead.
