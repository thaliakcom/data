      The cat casts the first [a:i-crave-violence] 10s after spawning, and thereafter casts one [a:i-crave-violence] every 15s, thus enraging approximately 40s after spawning. However, this enrage can be delayed by deliberately letting one player be hit by [a:i-crave-violence], which prevents the cat from gaining a stack of [s:huffy-cat]. Please note, however, that the penalties for being hit by [a:i-crave-violence] are extremely harsh; see [a:i-crave-violence] for more information.

    mechanic: aoe
    description: |
      Combines any two of the following types of AoEs:
      * 3 winged bombs ([a:burst])
      * 3 non-winged bombs ([a:burst])
      * Succubus ([a:dark-mist])
      * Morbol ([a:bad-breath])
      Winged bombs jump forward before exploding. Non-winged bombs explode where they are. Succubi resolve into a large [ms:defamation]-style AoE. Morbols release a wide [ms:cone].
      These summons can only spawn next to each other, at a 90° angle, never opposite. Both summons *can* be the same. Each AoE combination leaves a safe spot in one single corner.
    resolve: |
      It is strongly recommended to place four rectangular markers on the intercardinals of the arena. In this case, positioning yourself for the prior [s:wingmark] jump is trivial; simply stand on the corner of one of those waymarks. This leaves only the exercise of identifying which AoEs to move *towards* and which AoEs to move *away* from.
      There are two for each: players should move close to the waymarks *close* to succubi and non-winged bombs, and move to the waymarks *opposite* winged bombs and morbols. The jump will then place players in the safe spot for that pattern.

  riverscape:
    id: 42595
    name: Sugarscape (River)
    mechanic: mech.arena
    description: |
      Paints a riverscape.
      The riverscape has three different states. All states feature three grass islands.
      State 1: There are bridges connecting the islands. Stepping into the water inflicts [s:fire-resistance-up] and [s:lightning-resistance-down-ii] until the player steps out. This allows players to survive [a:taste-of-fire], but [a:taste-of-thunder] becomes lethal.
      State 2: There are still bridges connecting the islands, but the river has turned into rapids, inflicting a heavy [s:dropsy] [t:DoT] if a player steps into them. This [t:DoT] does *not* fade when the player steps out of the river.
      State 3: The river has turned into lava and the bridges are removed. Stepping into the lava river or attempting to gapclose across instantly kills the player. The only means of moving to a different island is via [s:wingmark].
      Note that this cast transforms the height of the arena floor. If a player is casting when the arena is transformed, their cast will be interrupted if it results in them dropping slightly. For that reason, it is recommended for casters to stand where the bridges are going to be when the cast ends.
  desertscape:
    id: 42600
    name: Sugarscape (Desert)

    description: |

      After the cast, all players are inflicted with [s:sweltering], a durationless [t:DoT] that lasts throughout the entirety of desert phase.
      Additionally, 1 random tank and 1 random damage dealer are inflicted with a 43s [s:heating-up], 1 random player with a 43s [s:burning-up], and both healers with a 74s [s:heating-up].

      Targets the *closest* player with whichever colour [boss] is pointing *up*.
      Targets the *farthest* player with whichever colour [boss] is pointing *down*.
      Blue equals [a:cool-bomb], orange equals [a:warm-bomb]. [a:cool-bomb] inflicts [s:cool-tint], a debuff that renders the next [a:cool-bomb] lethal. [a:warm-bomb] inflicts [s:warm-tint], rendering the next [a:warm-bomb] lethal. These debuffs never expire.
      Note that close/far colours may swap on each tankbuster, meaning that if the first tankbuster in the fight has [a:warm-bomb] hitting closest and [a:cool-bomb] hitting farthest, the next one could be the same, or it could be the opposite.
    resolve: |
      For the first tankbuster in the fight, it doesn't matter which tank takes the close and which tank the far bomb. However, for each subsequent tankbuster both tanks will have opposite [s:warm-tint]/[s:cool-tint] debuffs. Therefore, on each subsequent tankbuster, tanks must identify which bomb is close and which is far, and take the one *opposite* of their current debuff.
      Be aware that each tankbuster *swaps* the debuff for the next one, so tanks must keep alternating between taking [a:warm-bomb] and [a:cool-bomb].

      Hits two random players with a [ms:chariot] that deals moderate damage and inflicts [s:mousse-mine] and [s:magic-vulnerability-up].
      At the end of the status effect, triggers [a:sticky-mousse-burst], a [m:stack.targeted] on the [s:mousse-mine] players.
      Note that, if multiple players are hit by the same [a:sticky-mousse], *all* players hit will be inflicted with [s:mousse-mine], rendering the mechanic unsurvivable as all those players will be hit with [stacks](m:stack.targeted) while they're on top of each other and cannot move.
    resolve: |
      Have players spread at standard [t:protean] positions. Once two players are inflicted with [s:mousse-mine], stack with the *closest* [s:mousse-mine] player. If both [s:mousse-mine] players are equidistant to you, rotate to the [s:mousse-mine] player clockwise from you.
      The mechanic is intended for an even 4-4 split, but a 3-stack *is* survivable with enough mitigation. A 2-stack is not survivable under any circumstances outside of [i:tank] limit break.

      Initiates adds phase.
      There are 5 types of adds:
      * **Yan**: Deals massive damage with each auto-attack. Enrages when it gets too close to a Mu, rendering every auto-attack lethal.
      * **Mu**: Deals moderate damage with each auto-attack. Enrages after [a:ready-ore-not], triggering [a:orerigato].
      * **Gimme Cat**: Uses [a:unlimited-craving] after it spawns, stealing the party's limit break gauge, then incessantly jumps around. 10 seconds after spawning, it uses [a:i-crave-violence]. It then uses [a:i-crave-violence] every 15s, with each cast granting one stack of [s:huffy-cat]. At [s:huffy-cat:3], Gimme Cat enrages with [a:hangry-hiss].
      * **Feather Ray**: Tethers to the first player who hits it. If no player hits it within approximately 5 seconds, tethers to a random player. Uses [a:water-iii] on the tethered player approximately every 9 seconds, dealing moderate damage and leaving behind a puddle. These puddles don't fade until the end of the phase, so its "enrage" is when the entire arena is covered by puddles.
      * **Jabberwock**: Targets a random healer with a headmarker. Shortly afterwards, uses [a:manxome-windersnatch] on that player, dealing heavy damage and inflicting [s:bind], then begins to slowly move towards that player. If the Jabberwock reaches that healer, it instantly kills them with [a:slayous-snicker-snack] and moves onto a different player.

    resolve: |
      Assuming all 4 of your melee players are on the southern island, and your 4 ranged players are split in healer/damage dealer pairs on each of the two northern islands, place either the healers or ranged damage dealers farthest from [boss] to ensure there's one stack per island, then just keep moving as a unit.
      Make sure not to place a puddle on top of a tower.

      Players remaining in the quicksand for too long are inflicted with [s:six-fulms-under], which gradually reduces movement speed until the player can no longer move at all, at which point they die instantly.

      In this stage, the river has turned into rapids and inflicts [s:dropsy] when players step into it.
      Additionally, spawns a giant thundercloud over one of the three islands. The thundercloud periodically explodes ([a:highlightning]), then moves to a different island.
      Finally, [a:lightning-bolt] AoEs randomly spawn throughout the arena at 3 second intervals.
