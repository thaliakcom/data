      Player is petrified and thus unable to act or move. Any damage instance results in instant death. Inflicted by [a:quarry-swamp]. Due to the unavoidable damage immediately following [a:quarry-swamp], this debuff is a death sentence.
      In Phase 3, adds can also be inflicted with this debuff, which is why it is recommended not to hit the Phase 3 adds at all until after [a:quarry-swamp], at which point a single point of damage will kill them instantly.

      Major mechanic.
      There are two types of responsibilities for this mechanic: [a:sinister-seeds-stars] and [a:sinister-seeds-aoes]. At the end of the cast, the closest 4 players are designated for one of these mechanics while the other 4 receive the other mechanic.
      [a:sinister-seeds-stars]: 4 players receive a headmarker along with a telegraphed AoE. After a significant delay, the AoE resolves, dealing moderate damage and leaving behind [a:tendrils-of-terror]; star-shaped AoEs where the AoE was dropped.
      [a:sinister-seeds-aoes]: several rounds of AoEs appear underneath the other 4 players. Any player hit by these is inflicted with [s:damage-down]. At the end of the mechanic, all dropped AoEs explode again with a much bigger radius ([a:roots-of-evil]).

      [boss] summons both a blade and a club and prepares to use both.
      Whichever weapon he uses first will glow. It is random whether the blade spawns in his left hand or his right, and vice-versa for the club.
      He tethers to one of the four walls, then jumps there, using the glowing weapon in a standard [a:brutish-swing]. This is immediately followed by a [a:revenge-of-the-vines-instant] without a cast bar and a [a:lashing-lariat]. The [a:lashing-lariat] is always on the side of his empty hand (where the first weapon used to be).
