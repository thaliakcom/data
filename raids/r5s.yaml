      Multiple telegraphed AoEs in a row. The frogs in the backrow indicate (by pointing towards it) which side [boss] will cleave.
      Additionally, [s:wavelength-î±] and [s:wavelength-î²] expire during this mechanic. Each Wavelength requires a player to be stacked tightly with a player of the opposite Wavelength whose debuff expires at the same time.
      Successfully dodging one of the [halfroom cleaves](ms:halfroom) increases the duty gauge. Successfully resolving a Wavelength debuff also increases the duty gauge.

      A mechanic with eight-and-a-half steps.
      There is a [ms:chariot] originating from the boss, which then alternates between a [ms:chariot] and [ms:dynamo] every subsequent step. Only the initial [ms:chariot] is telegraphed.
      Additionally, each step involves one player being targeted by [a:get-down-cone], a [ms:cone] that inflicts [s:magic-vulnerability-up] and either [s:wavelength-î±] or [s:wavelength-î²]. This targeted cone alternates between targeting a damage dealer and a support. All damage dealers will have the same Wavelength debuff (but with different durations), and supports will have the other Wavelength. The cones target each player only once, unless another player dies.
      After being hit by a cone, an [m:aoe.aftershock] will hit the same area again in the next step. The last (half) step merely features this [m:aoe.aftershock] without the [ms:chariot] or [ms:dynamo].
      At the start of the mechanic, [boss] disables positionals on his hitbox.
      A duty gauge will appear at the start of this mechanic. The duty gauge increments by a random amount each time players successfully avoid an AoE. This applies to [a:get-down-dynamo], [a:get-down-chariot], and [a:get-down-aftershock]. If a player gets hit by any of these mechanics, the duty gauge increases by a reduced amount.
    resolve: |
      Spread loosely within two groups: damage dealers and supports. The preferred strategy is north for supports and south for damage dealers, but west/east works just as well.
      Start out. After the [ms:chariot] resolves, move into the hitbox. Wait until the [ms:dynamo] resolves, then move back out.
      Rinse and repeat until you get hit by a cone, at which point move *diagonally* – move in/out just as before, but this time move laterally as well, to the spot of your neighbouring damage dealer/support. Since the cones always alternate between damage dealers and supports, there is no risk of the person you're moving on top of being targeted by a cone as well, as long as you don't move atop someone of a different role. After your [m:aoe.aftershock] resolves, move diagonally back to your original position.

      Grants [s:perfect-groove] to any player who successfully resolved their [s:wavelength-î±]/[s:wavelength-î²] and avoided all of [a:lets-dance!].
      These players don't take any damage. All other players take heavy damage.
      If the duty gauge is full at this point (which requires all mechanics to be resolved perfectly), the party is granted one full bar of limit break.
