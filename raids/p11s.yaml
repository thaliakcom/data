    resolve: |
      Take your light party to either the east or west, which will always be safe. After the clones dash, move into the dark dash. Wait until [boss] has dashed, then either move into his dash with your partner or go to max melee with your light party.
      **Important**: The main tank has an important responsibility during this mechanic, as the way [boss] dashes is determined by which way the tank faces him. It is strongly recommended to wait until the clones begin to indicate their colour, then point the boss at or opposite the *light clone*. Do *not* point him at the dark clone, as this means there is no safe spot during the mechanic.

Players with [s:polarizing] instantly die at the end of the mechanic.
      A pair of partners that share the same tether colour must stay far away from each other.
      A pair of partners that have different tether colours must stack on top of each other.
      There will always be two "far" pairs and two "close" pairs.
