      Take your light party to either the east or west, which will always be safe. After the clones dash, move into the dark dash. Wait until [boss] has dashed, then either move into his dash with your partner or go to max melee with your light party.
      **Important**: The main tank has an important responsibility during this mechanic, as the way [boss] dashes is determined by which way the tank faces him. It is strongly recommended to wait until the clones begin to indicate their colour, then point the boss at or opposite the *light clone*. Do *not* point him at the dark clone, as this means there is no safe spot during the mechanic.

      A pair of partners that share the same tether colour must stay far away from each other.

    resolve: Use standard [a:inevitable-sentence] partners. It is recommended to handle this mechanic [t:true north], allowing you to target a waymarker while you're waiting for the preceding [a:upheld-ruling] to resolve, then beeline for that marker once you've escaped [a:dark-perimeter].
