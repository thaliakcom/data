      Inflicts [s:curse-of-the-bombpyre] on all players and spawns a number of bats and an expanding circle.
      The circle begins expanding from the center of the arena. When the circle touches a bat, the bat explodes ([a:blast-beat-bat]), dealing moderate damage and inflicting [s:magic-vulnerability-up] and [s:damage-down] on all nearby players. When the circle touches a player, cleanses [s:curse-of-the-bombpyre] and triggers another explosion ([a:blast-beat-cleanse]) that also deals moderate damage and inflicts [s:magic-vulnerability-up].
      Players who already cleansed [s:curse-of-the-bombpyre] do not trigger [a:blast-beat-cleanse] if they touch the circle again.
      As both [a:blast-beat-bat] and [a:blast-beat-cleanse] inflict [s:magic-vulnerability-up], touching the circle shortly before or after being hit by an exploding bat, or clipping another player with [a:blast-beat-cleanse], deals lethal damage.
    resolve: |
      It is generally recommended for tanks and melees to cleanse [s:curse-of-the-bombpyre] first so they can get back into melee range of [boss] sooner. Rangeds can wait until the circle reaches them. Either way all players should be spread out, for instance by positioning one melee and one ranged player on each cardinal.

      At the same time, 2 players per set are marked and are shortly thereafter hit by a small [m:spread] AoE. This AoE leaves behind a plus- or cross-shaped AoE that resolves after all players have dropped their AoE.
    strategies:
      center-safe:
        name: Center Safe
        description: |
          A simple braindead strategy that leaves the center safe. Each player is assigned a clock spot. When a player gets marked, they move out to the wall exactly halfway between their own clock spot and the clock spot counter-clockwise to them. Each player drops their AoE in this position, then at the end everyone stacks dead-center in the middle of the arena, under the boss. If all AoEs were placed correctly, the center will be completely safe, regardless of whether anyone's AoE was a cross or a plus.
          This strategy also allows you to essentially ignore the rotating cones, as halfway between each marker is where one cone ends and another begins, allowing players to dodge a cone by simply taking a small step sideways.

      A mini-phase that involves two large buzzsaws and two small chakrams constantly moving back and forth throughout the arena. Any player touching these saws ([a:gravegrazer]) is inflicted with [s:flesh-wound].
      There are three sets of adds. Each set begins with a tank tower in the northern and southern half of the arena that must be soaked ([a:plummet]) or they explode ([a:massive-impact]), inflicting [s:sustained-damage]. Afterwards, spawns three adds: 2 Fatal Flails where the two towers were soaked, and 1 Deadly Doornail.
      The Flatal Fails immediately begin casting [a:barbed-burst], a 16 second cast that must be canceled by destroying the flail or it will deal heavy damage and inflict [s:damage-down] on all players.
      The Deadly Doornail spawns with a small purple puddle underneath it that gradually [expands](m:aoe.expanding). Any player who steps into this puddle is inflicted with [s:electrocution], a heavy DoT. If the doornail is not killed in time, it will likely cover the entirety of the next [a:plummet] tower with its puddle and make crossing through the middle difficult or impossible.
    resolve: |
      Have the main tank soak the northern [a:plummet] tower and the off-tank soak the southern [a:plummet] tower. Melees can get a [t:GCD] or two off on the Deadly Doornail before switching to the Fatal Flails. Tanks cannot kill these alone outside of burst and will likely need help. Ranged damage dealers focus on the Deadly Doornail.

      Four towers spawn around the arena. Each tower must be soaked by one person ([a:bloody-bondage]).
      After being soaked, the tower turns into a charnel cell. Each charnel cell has the status effect [s:heel-of-the-cell]. The soakee is inflicted with [s:hell-in-a-cell] and [s:hell-awaits] and cannot leave the cell until the cell is destroyed. Only the initial soakee (and inmate) can deal damage to the cell. While in the cell, they take constant damage every 3 seconds ([a:blood-lash]).
      Meanwhile, the 4 players outside the cells have to deal with [a:ultrasonic-amp] and [a:ultrasonic-spread]. [boss] casts both mechanics, the only variance is which one the boss casts first. Care must be taken to ensure the ultrasonic cones don't hit any players in a cell. This is always possible as two, and only two, towers are always guaranteed to spawn directly side-by-side, meaning there are always 3 gaps available (2 smaller gaps and 1 large gap).
      After this is done, 4 more towers spawn and the mechanic repeats.
    resolve: |
      Standard light party split. Light party 1 soaks the first set of towers while light party 2 stays outside. Then light party 2 soaks the second set of towers while light party 1 stays outside. Due to [a:ultrasonic-spread] (a tankbuster) it is vital that there is a tank available outside a cell during both sets.

      Two [stack towers](m:stack.tower) spawn.
      After resolving, each tower spawns a bat. Each bat will attempt to chain itself to the closest 4 players.* The bat then begins moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise around the arena until they complete a 180 degree rotation, at which point they perform either [a:breakdown-drop] ([ms:chariot]) or [a:breakwing-beat] ([ms:dynamo]) as indicated by an icon above the bat during its rotation. They may flip direction at this point, or they may not, and begin moving back to their point of origin, at which point they again perform either [a:breakdown-drop] or [a:breakwing-beat]. A bat may perform the same or opposite types of AoE each time. Whichever AoE the first bat performs, the other bat performs the opposite type of AoE.
      Players may not move too far away from the bat they are chained to. If they do, they are inflicted with [s:damage-down] and dealt a massive amount of damage ([a:explosion]).
      At the same time [boss] casts [a:sanguine-scratch], a set of [m:aoe.alternating].
      * If 4 players soak each tower as intended, each bat will simply tether to the 4 players who soaked the tower. If someone goes to the wrong tower and the towers are soaked in a 5/3 split, one of the players in the 5-stack will be tethered to the bat across the arena, resulting in an instant [s:damage-down] and damage from being too far away from their bat.
