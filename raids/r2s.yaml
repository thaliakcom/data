  A deceptively simple but punishing second turn revolving around memorization mechanics and 3 "Beats" mechanics that transform the arena while adding the mechanic of "heart stacks" to the fight. During these mechanics, any improperly resolved mechanic adds a heart stack to players. Reach 4 stacks and not only is the player stunned for 6 seconds, they also grant [boss] a stacking damage buff and heal her by 1% of her maximum HP, making the DPS check significantly harder. This makes this turn one of the most punishing second turn savages in history.

      [Soaking a tower](a:fracture) inflicts a stack of [s:infatuated]. Though towers are statistically predisposed towards spawning on a cardinal or intercardinal, they do not have fixed spawn points and can spawn anywhere in the arena. Towers can never spawn in the center of the arena.
    resolve: |
      Since each player will have a random number of heart stacks at this point, it is recommended to prioritize having 0-stack or 1-stack players soak towers. Divide your party into 4 groups – you can use the partner pairs from [a:drop-of-venom] for this – and have each group preposition within their quarter of the arena.
      Make sure that, at the end of this mechanic, there are at least 4 players with less than [s:hopeless-devotion]. This is why it is recommended to distribute the heart stacks among the party evenly. At the end of this mechanic, there should not be any players left with 0 stacks or [s:infatuated].
      If possible, try to give your caster(s) and healers [s:hopeless-devotion]. This exempts them from stacking for [a:heartsick] and avoids unnecessary movement.

If less than 4 players share the AoE, some players receive 2 or more stacks, potentially inflicting [s:honey-bee-mine].
      If multiple players have the lowest number of heart stacks, randomly chooses a player among them for the AoE.
    resolve: |
      All players with [s:head-over-heels] or less should stack with the targeted player. The hearts are still moving around the arena here, so everyone in the stack will have to keep moving the same way to avoid them. This is why it is recommended to give your caster(s) and healers [s:hopeless-devotion], as it exempts them from the stack, allowing them to simply chill somewhere on the outside of the arena to minimize movement.

      Each bee faces a player's position at the time of their spawn, indicated by an arrow. After a few seconds, the bee shoots [a line AoE](a:blinding-love) in the indicated direction, inflicting [s:damage-down] and knocking all hit players back.
      There is a one second interval between the resolution of every [a:blinding-love].

      - Use [a:arms-length] or [a:surecast] if you're in a tough spot and think you might get hit. You'll take the [s:damage-down], but you won't be knocked into the wall and killed.

      Continuously spawns bees on the outside of the arena.
      Unlike the first [a:alarm-pheromones-1], this time the bees spawn in a fixed pattern and aim their [a:blinding-love] AoE across the arena instead of targeting players. 4 bees spawn in a rectangular pattern, and their lines create a safe spot in the center of the arena as well as 4 evenly spaced-out safe spots around the outside. There are 6 sets of this. Each set rotates the cage slightly clockwise or counter-clockwise. The direction of rotation does not change throughout the rest of the mechanic.
      Additionally, during the first 4 sets 1 random support and 1 random DPS are targeted by [a:poison-sting], an attack indicated by a marker above those 2 players' heads that inflicts [s:magic-vulnerability-up] and leaves behind a [m:aoe.puddle] at their position that inflicts [s:toxicosis] to players stepping inside.
      During the last two sets, [boss] uses [a:bee-sting], a [m:stack.role].
    resolve: |
      Have the party stack center. Separate DPS from supports: supports are slightly north-ish, DPS slightly south-ish.
      For each set, check which two players are marked and have those players move out of the center, to the outside of the arena inside one of the 4 safe spots. For the first set, have the marked support go to the northmost safe spot and the marked DPS to the southmost safe spot. After dropping their puddle, they return to the center. Every subsequent player simply has to place their own puddle directly clockwise or counter-clockwise (depending on the rotation of the bees) of the previous puddle.
      Be aware that the cardinals may be unsafe during the first set. In that case, go to the safe spot closest to north/south. Whatever the case, try to make sure to always go opposite the other marked player, otherwise there may not be enough space for the last player to drop their puddle next to the previous puddle.
      For [a:bee-sting], it is paramount that both stacks are taken in the center, in opposite *corners* of the [a:blinding-love] line AoEs. If these stacks are simply taken north and south, there is not enough space available to prevent the other stack from being clipped.

    description: |
      Transitions the arena, grants [boss] [s:top-of-the-hive], and inflicts [s:infatuated] on 2 supports and 2 DPS players.
      Soon thereafter, one of the [s:infatuated] supports and one of the DPS are targeted by [a:heart-struck], baited AoEs that spawn at an interval of 2 seconds each. They are also targeted by [a:heartsick], a stack that evenly distributes 2 stacks of [s:infatuated] between all players hit.
      Some time after, spawns two towers east and west. Same as the [a:beat-1] towers, they require one player inside to soak them, or else a stack of [s:infatuated] is inflicted on every player. Before the towers resolve, two of the players (one support, one DPS) without [s:infatuated] are targeted by [a:heartsore], an unavoidable AoE that inflicts [s:infatuated] on all players hit.
      At the end of the mechanic, executes the previously stored [a:spread-love-hit] or [a:drop-of-love-hit].
    resolve: |
      Unlike [a:beat-1], this mechanic has no leeway. Every player must take exactly one stack of [s:infatuated]. If any player takes more, [boss] is guaranteed to be granted [s:queen-bee] due to the [a:spread-love-hit]/[a:drop-of-love-hit] at the end, which inflicts a heart stack on all players.
      The intended way to resolve the first part of the mechanic is to have your 0-stack players stack up and your [s:infatuated] players spread into two role stacks, so that both of the two stacks are soaked by two players.
      However, thanks to the way [a:heartsick] distributes its hearts, there is a simpler way to resolve the mechanic: by simply having all 0-stack players stack and all [s:infatuated] players stack. The 0-stack players can stack in the center of [boss]'s hitbox while the [s:infatuated] players stack outside (usually south) and rotate clockwise to avoid the baited [a:heart-struck] AoEs. Make sure to move together, as all 4 players must be hit by both [a:heartsick] stacks. If done properly, all 4 of those players now have [s:head-over-heels].
      Once the telegraph for [a:heartsore] goes out, the two marked 0-stack players move out of the center immediately. Try to avoid both the towers and the rotating 1-stack players. There are now only two 0-stack players remaining, one support and one DPS; those 2 players must soak the towers (one each).
      If executed correctly, all players should now have [s:head-over-heels], and after the subsequent [a:spread-love-hit]/[a:drop-of-love-hit] [s:hopeless-devotion].

    damage: 149150
    description: |
      Transitions the arena, grants [boss] [s:top-of-the-hive], and inflicts [s:poison-n-pop] on all players.
      The timers between supports and DPS players are different. One role's [s:poison-n-pop] has a duration of 26s, the other role 46s.
      After a [a:centerstage-combo]/[a:outerstage-combo], 4 towers appear slightly offset from each intercardinal. The first role's [s:poison-n-pop] expires here, causing those players to explode in a massive [ms:defamation]-type AoE that inflicts [s:infatuated].
      After another [a:centerstage-combo]/[a:outerstage-combo], another 4 towers appear slightly offset from each intercardinal. The second role's [s:poison-n-pop] expires here.
      Finally, resolves the previously stored [a:drop-of-love] or [a:spread-love].
    resolve: |
      Like before, the mechanic has no leeway. If any player gets hit by anything they're not supposed to, or if any towers explode, [a:beat-3] is no longer cleanly resolvable and [boss] is guaranteed to come out of it with one or more stacks of [s:queen-bee].
      Designate a spread position for every player at the edge of the arena. (Check strategies for info about common strats.) Then, dodge the first [a:centerstage-combo]/[a:outerstage-combo] near your spread position so you only have to backpedal at the end of that mechanic to resolve [s:poison-n-pop]. The players whose [s:poison-n-pop] is not about to resolve stack in the very center of the arena.
      **Do not go to your tower after [a:centerstage-combo]/[a:outerstage-combo].** The [s:poison-n-pop] AoEs are so large that they cover all towers. Only step into your tower (usually dictated by your [a:drop-of-venom-hit] position) after [s:poison-n-pop] has expired.
      Then do the same thing, but swap the roles.

        description: Designate a clock position for everyone, but always put defamations on the cardinals. If your clock position is not a cardinal, take the cardinal whose marker has the same colour as your clock marker.

        description: All players dodge [a:centerstage-combo]/[a:outerstage-combo] on the two markers that have the same colour as their clock position marker.

      Raidwide that deals heavy damage, transitions the arena into its final state, and begins the enrage sequence.
      Grants [boss] [s:rotten-honey] (which has no effect) and 4 players [s:beeloved-venom-alpha] and 4 players [s:beeloved-venom-beta]. Each [s:beeloved-venom-alpha] has a different duration that corresponds with one [s:beeloved-venom-beta]. If a player with [s:beeloved-venom-alpha] touches a player with [s:beeloved-venom-beta], they explode, dealing raidwide damage and inflicting [s:magic-vulnerability-up]. If any debuffs are allowed to expire instead, those players are instantly killed, but without affecting anyone else.
    resolve: |
      Have all players spread to clock positions to avoid accidentally touching another player. After each [a:call-me-honey], wait for both heals and for [s:magic-vulnerability-up] to expire, then have the next Beeloved Venoms to expire go in the center of [boss]'s hitbox to resolve their debuffs.
      Be aware that the [s:magic-vulnerability-up] inflicted by [a:rotten-big-burst] lasts for 7 seconds. This means that if the debuffs are resolved at 3s or less, a wipe is guaranteed as the subsequent [a:call-me-honey] instantly kills all players. It is recommended to resolve the debuffs at about 7s remaining.
      If a pair of debuffs missed their cleanse window, meaning that there is no longer enough time to cleanse the debuff and wait for [s:magic-vulnerability-up] to expire before [a:call-me-honey], it is recommended not to cleanse the debuff at all and let the affected players die instead. This will not cause a wipe.
