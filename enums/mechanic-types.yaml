aoe.intercept:
  name: interceptable attack
  description: |
    An attack targeting a specific player that must be intercepted by another player or the first player will die.
    This type of mechanic often appears in the form of a tankbuster, where the attack deals heavy damage to the first player(s) hit and medium damage to all players behind them, generally requiring tanks to intercept the attack by standing in front of the party and using defensive cooldowns.
    These attacks often (but not always) target a specific but unmarked non-tank player, forcing you to treat the mechanic like a line stack with the whole party in the stack and the tanks in front, even though the damage is not actually reduced for having additional players in the hit.
