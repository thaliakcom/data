    In general, these towers appear in three variants: two towers appearing at the same time, requiring a tank in each one; one tower appearing that requires *both* tanks to soak and split the damage; or one tower appearing that hits multiple times and requires a different tank inside for each hit.

  shapeful: true
stack.tower:
  name: stack tower
  description: |
    Similar to an ordinary tower mechanic, markers or towers appear in certain locations in the arena that require soaking (i.e. if no one is in the tower or marker, it's usually a party wipe).
    Unlike regular tower mechanics, however, this type of mechanic does not do fixed but shareable damage, meaning that as many party members as possible should be in each stack to reduce the damage taken.

  shapeful: true
aoe.orbs:
  name: orbs
  description: |
    Orbs that slowly move through the arena. If a player touches these orbs, they "pop", dealing massive damage and inflicting debuffs.
    In general, there are 3 types of orbs: orbs that travel towards a fixed point in the arena, orbs that chase a player, and orbs that take a player's position when they spawn and move towards that location, regardless of whether or not the player moves away.
aoe.rotating:
  name: rotating AoEs
  description: These [AoEs](t:AoE) rotate around the arena. Players must identify which direction the AoEs will rotate in to avoid standing in its immediate path, then follow the AoEs as they rotate.

aoe.expanding.rings:
  name: expanding rings
  description: A ring-shaped ([ms:dynamo]) AoE that hits multiple times, where each hit features a larger ring that hits the area just outside the previous ring. These kinds of attacks only stop once the entire arena has been hit by the rings. Players must stand just outside one ring, then step into that ring once it resolves to avoid the next ring.
aoe.intercept:
  name: interceptable attack
  description: |
    An attack targeting a specific player that must be intercepted by another player or the first player will die.
    This type of mechanic often appears in the form of a tankbuster, where the attack deals heavy damage to the first player(s) hit and medium damage to all players behind them, generally requiring tanks to intercept the attack by standing in front of the party and using defensive cooldowns.
    These attacks often (but not always) target a specific but unmarked non-tank player, forcing you to treat the mechanic like a line stack with the whole party in the stack and the tanks in front, even though the damage is not actually reduced for having additional players in the hit.
  shapeful: true

  name: lingering AoE
  description: |
    An attack that spawns in a specific location (often on a player's location) and lingers for some time, dealing heavy damage to any players entering this area. Similar to a [m:aoe.baitable], the general solution is to drop this AoE away from other players, then step out of its area of effect as quickly as possible to minimize damage taken.
  shapeful: true
aoe.memory:
  name: multi-AoE
  description: |
    Telegraphs multiple AoEs in a sequence that then resolve in fast succession. Players must memorize in which order these AoEs are executed in and stay out of the first AoE, then move into the second, and so on, as the combined sum of these AoEs generally cover the entire arena.
