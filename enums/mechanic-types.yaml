  description: |
    A mechanic that requires affected players to stack with at least one other party member. They will not receive damage, but failing to stack will generally inflict heavy damage or debuffs.

stack.intercept:
  name: Wild Charge
  description: |
    A stack (almost always in the shape of a line) that has a different effect on the first player(s) hit than the players behind them.
    In practice, this usually translates to the first target(s) taking massive damage and requiring the use of tank cooldowns to live, with non-tanks behind them. In some cases, however, the first target(s) may simply be inflicted with a special status effect.
    Named after Imdugud's eponymous attack, [a:2134].

  shapeful: true
stack.tower:
  name: stack tower
  description: |
    Similar to an ordinary tower mechanic, markers or towers appear in certain locations in the arena that require soaking (i.e. if no one is in the tower or marker, it's usually a party wipe).
    Unlike regular tower mechanics, however, this type of mechanic does not do fixed but shareable damage, meaning that as many party members as possible should be in each stack to reduce the damage taken.

  shapeful: true
aoe.orbs:
  name: orbs
  description: |
    Orbs that slowly move through the arena. If a player touches these orbs, they "pop", dealing massive damage and inflicting debuffs.
    In general, there are 3 types of orbs: orbs that travel towards a fixed point in the arena, orbs that chase a player, and orbs that take a player's position when they spawn and move towards that location, regardless of whether or not the player moves away.
aoe.rotating:
  name: rotating AoEs
  description: These [AoEs](t:AoE) rotate around the arena. Players must identify which direction the AoEs will rotate in to avoid standing in its immediate path, then follow the AoEs as they rotate.

  description: |
    A ring-shaped ([ms:dynamo]) AoE that hits multiple times, where each hit features a larger ring that hits the area just outside the previous ring. These kinds of attacks only stop once the entire arena has been hit by the rings. Players must stand just outside one ring, then step into that ring once it resolves to avoid the next ring.
    Also sometimes called *quakes*, *exadonuts*, or *exarings*.
aoe.intercept:
  name: interceptable attack
  description: |
    An attack targeting a specific player that must be intercepted by another player or the first player will die.
    This type of mechanic often appears in the form of a tankbuster, where the attack deals heavy damage to the first player(s) hit and medium damage to all players behind them, generally requiring tanks to intercept the attack by standing in front of the party and using defensive cooldowns.
    These attacks often (but not always) target a specific but unmarked non-tank player, forcing you to treat the mechanic like a line stack with the whole party in the stack and the tanks in front, even though the damage is not actually reduced for having additional players in the hit.
  shapeful: true
aoe.chasing:
  name: chasing AoE
  description: |
    An attack that spawns a delayed AoE underneath a player's location, then begins to chase them. Any player in the path of the AoE (including the targeted player themselves) take heavy damage and debuffs.
  shapeful: true
aoe.linger:
  name: lingering AoE
  description: |
    An attack that spawns in a specific location (often on a player's location) and lingers for some time, dealing heavy damage to any players entering this area. Similar to a [m:aoe.baitable], the general solution is to drop this AoE away from other players, then step out of its area of effect as quickly as possible to minimize damage taken.
  shapeful: true
aoe.puddle:
  name: puddle
  description: |
    An attack that leaves behind a puddle in a specific location (often on a player's location), usually inflicting a (often lethal) [t:DoT] to any players who step onto this puddle at any point before it fades.

  shapeful: true
aoe.memory:
  name: multi-AoE
  description: |
    Telegraphs multiple AoEs in a sequence that then resolve in fast succession. Players must memorize in which order these AoEs are executed in and stay out of the first AoE, then move into the second, and so on, as the combined sum of these AoEs generally cover the entire arena.
  shapeful: true

  name: conditional
  description: |
    An arena-wide AoE that hits any player who doesn't fulfill a specific condition.

  description: An unavoidable player-targeted [t:AoE] that deals damage to a random player of each role (usually tanks, healers, DPS) and all players around them.

Nowadays, a "trio" mechanic doesn't necessarily have anything to do with "three" and is instead usually marked by one or multiple of the following characteristics:
    * a complex mechanic with several moving parts layered on top of each other
    * the individual parts of the mechanic execute in quick succession
    * those individual parts are often executed by different bosses
    * all enemies are untargetable for the duration of the mechanic
mech.check:

mech.center-or-sides:
  name: center or sides
  description: A mechanic with 2 variations. Players must either get to the sides of the arena (due to a line AoE through the center) or to the center of the arena (due to two line AoEs on the sides). The only way to tell which variation the boss is using is some boss or arena tell like a specific stance, VFX, or animation.
mech.store:
  name: store
  description: Instead of executing the mechanic immediately, the boss instead *stores* it, executing it after some series of other mechanics. This requires players to member *what* attack the boss stored, so they can avoid it accordingly when it is finally executed.
mech.gaze:

  description: Players are tethered to something else (usually another player). The tether must be broken by increasing the length of the tether until it snaps within a given amount of time, or the player (and their partner) take heavy damage and debuffs. Note that, with this type of tether, the required length to snap the tether is based on the tether's initial length, so it is recommended to have all players stack before the tether is applied, otherwise it may be impossible to establish sufficient distance to snap the tether.
mech.tether.distance:
  name: distance tethers
  description: Players are tethered to something else and must be at least a certain distance away from the source of their tether. If they are far enough away, their tether appears as a yellow line, otherwise as red-purple arrows pointing out from the center of the tether.
