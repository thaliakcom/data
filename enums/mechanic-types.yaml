    Named after Imdugud's eponymous attack, [a:2134].
  is-raid-damage: true
stack.tower:

  description: |
    Similar to an ordinary tower mechanic, markers or towers appear in certain locations in the arena that require soaking (i.e. if no one is in the tower or marker, it's usually a party wipe).

  description: A ring-shaped ([ms:dynamo]) AoE that hits multiple times, where each hit features a larger ring that hits the area just outside the previous ring. These kinds of attacks only stop once the entire arena has been hit by the rings. Players must stand just outside one ring, then step into that ring once it resolves to avoid the next ring.
aoe.intercept:
  name: interceptable attack
  description: |
    An attack targeting a specific player that must be intercepted by another player or the first player will die.
    This type of mechanic often appears in the form of a tankbuster, where the attack deals heavy damage to the first player(s) hit and medium damage to all players behind them, generally requiring tanks to intercept the attack by standing in front of the party and using defensive cooldowns.
    These attacks often (but not always) target a specific but unmarked non-tank player, forcing you to treat the mechanic like a line stack with the whole party in the stack and the tanks in front, even though the damage is not actually reduced for having additional players in the hit.

aoe.memory:
  name: multi-AoE
  description: |
    Telegraphs multiple AoEs in a sequence that then resolve in fast succession. Players must memorize in which order these AoEs are executed in and stay out of the first AoE, then move into the second, and so on, as the combined sum of these AoEs generally cover the entire arena.
