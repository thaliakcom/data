    mechanic: adds
    description: |
      Ser Zephirin appears in the middle of the arena, becomes targetable, and starts casting [a:sacred-cross], a light DPS check.
      Afterward Ser Ignasse, Ser Paulecrain, and Ser Vellguine appear on clock spots at the edge of the arena and begin casting [a:spiral-thrust], dashing across the arena and knocking anyone hit into the wall. These knights will never appear opposite each other, meaning that 6 clock positions will be in the path of their dashes.
    resolve: |
      Reduce Ser Zephirin below 50% health as soon as possible to reduce the damage from [a:sacred-cross] to survivable levels, then position yourself on one of the two clock spots that the knights are not dashing through.
      Alternatively, simply position yourself at the edge of the arena right in-between two prongs of the star on the arena floor, as this position is always safe regardless of the knights' dashes.

    description: |
      Ser Zephirin casts [a:sacred-cross]. When he finishes the cast, deals twice Ser Zephirin's remaining health percentage to all party members relative to your maximum health.
      So, for instance, if you have 47,000 max HP and your tanks have 60,000 max HP, the attack will deal 120,000 damage to tanks and 94,000 damage to everyone else if you don't damage Ser Zephirin at all. This means that the attack becomes survivable after damaging Ser Zephirin to roughly 50% health with sufficient mitigation and/or shields.

    mechanic: adds
    compact: full
    description: |
      Ser Janleneoux and Ser Adelphel appear on the east and west side of the arena and become targetable.
      After some time, they will both cast [a:divine-right], giving a random one of the two [s:sword-of-the-heavens] (a significant damage buff) and the other [s:shield-of-the-heavens] (a significant defense increase). If they are ever too close to each other, they will tether to each other, granting both knights both buffs.
      They will then cycle through [a:holy-bladedance] (a telegraped tankbuster), [a:heavenly-slash] (an untelegraphed tankbuster), and [a:holiest-of-holy] (a raidwide). If you fail to kill one of the two knights in time, they will cast [a:divine-right] once again, switching their buffs and forcing you to target the other knight. Halfway through this phase, three other knights join the fray and mark random players with blue markers, indicating that they will be targeted by a [a:skyward-leap], dealing heavy damage to them and anyone close to them.
      As soon as one of the two knights is killed, the other immediately loses their [s:sword-of-the-heavens] or [s:shield-of-the-heavens].
      This phase does not have a DPS check. If not killed "in time," both knights will continue to cycle through [a:divine-right], [a:holy-bladedance], and [a:holiest-of-holy] endlessly. Be aware, though, that [boss]'s limit break gauge will eventually hit 100. This won't end the phase prematurely, but it will cause [a:ultimate-end] to deal increased damage once you get there.
    resolve: |
      Keep the knights separated (ideally east and west, with one tank taking each knight) at all times to ensure they don't tether. Always target the knight with [s:sword-of-the-heavens], as the other is nigh invulnerable.
      If you have [t:DoT] abilities, try to put them on both knights before they cast the first [a:divine-right], as any DoTs inflicted before [s:shield-of-the-heavens] are unaffected by the defense increase.
      Once blue markers appear, place the first north, the second south, and the third north again, to ensure the other party members only take minimal damage from each jump.
      If you're tanking the knight with [s:sword-of-the-heavens] beware, as his [a:holy-bladedance] deals massive amounts of damage, requiring heavy mitigation or [t:invuln]s.

      Ser Grinnaux places AoEs underneath each player and begins casting [a:dimensional-collapse], gradually expanding the AoEs until the cast has finished.
      Meanwhile, all untethered players receive an ice marker, indicating they will be hit by [a:hiemal-storm] soon, dealing mild damage and leaving a frost puddle behind that inflicts [s:frostbite] if anyone steps in it.
      Finally, Ser Grinnaux uses [a:faith-unmoving], knocking all players back from his position.
    resolve: |
      Stack in the center of the arena and wait for the red [a:dimensional-collapse] AoEs to appear. Once they do, move to your clock spot. If you are targeted by [a:hiemal-storm], wait until the frost puddle appears, then move out of it while still avoiding [a:dimensional-collapse].
      Once [a:dimensional-collapse] resolves, quickly move back to the center while lining yourself up with any part of the arena that *doesn't* have a [a:hiemal-storm] puddle there, so that the ensuing knockback does not knock you into the death wall or a frost puddle.

After [a:dimensional-collapse], [boss] begins casting [a:the-dragons-rage]. At the same time Ser Grinnaux uses [a:faith-unmoving], knocking back all players from his position.
    resolve: |
      Assign four players to handle towers (ideally all ranged players so the melees can keep attacking [boss]) and an order in which to take them. Party finder usually does (from left to right) R1 H1 H2 R2. Be aware that it is not guaranteed for 2 towers to spawn for each side; it can also spawn 1 tower on one side and 3 towers on the other. Tower players should dodge [a:heavy-impact] inside their towers, as [a:conviction] will resolve before all [a:heavy-impact] hits are done.
      Afterward, quickly locate Ser Grinnaux and either move toward him or use knockback immunity. If you're a melee, prefer to take boss downtime over not being in the stack, as this mechanic is a frequent wipe point.

      [boss] summons his knights, who begin to execute a series of mechanics.
      [a:lightning-storm] is a standard spread mechanic. After that, one knight appears at a random position on the edge of the arena and begins casting [a:spiral-thrust]. Meanwhile, one player is tethered and targeted by [a:spiral-pierce], one player receives a blue marker and is targeted by [a:skyward-leap], and one player is targeted by [a:the-dragons-rage].
    resolve: |
      Standard spread. Then, try to find the knight [a:spiral-thrust] knight and avoid the line he will dash through. If you have a tether or a blue marker, stay out of the stack.

      Ser Zephirin throws an aetheric spear at the healer who is [s:down-for-the-count], intending to inflict upon them the same fate as poor Haurchefant.
      This attack splits damage between all players hit, reducing damage to survivable levels. The first player hit takes drastically increased damage (about twice as much as everyone else) and is inflicted with [s:physical-vuln].
      Any player hit is inflicted with [s:infirmity], slightly reducing healing received.
      If any player (including the targeted healer) dies to this attack, Ser Zephirin immediately follows up with a maximum damage [a:sacred-cross], wiping the party.
    resolve:
      All players (except the main tank, who will be busy dealing with a simultaneous [a:heavenly-heel]) must stack in front of the targeted healer. The off-tank must be the closest player to Ser Zephirin, to ensure they get hit first. Be aware that they cannot take enmity from [boss] afterwards, due to their [s:physical-vuln].
