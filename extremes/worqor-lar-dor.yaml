  A relatively simple fight, Valigarmanda nonetheless requires a quick eye to spot the danger zone both within and without the arena, and also features one of the coolest tankbusters this game has ever seen.

      Telegraphs 10 subsequent ice curves.
      The curves always start towards either the left or right side of the middle of the arena and move towards the *far* side. Note that the curves are always angled towards the *far* side of the arena, so after the first curve, the curves will now curve towards the *other* side since that side is now farther away.
      Each curve spawns an ice block somewhere along its trajectory. The first 4 curves spawn their ice block at the origin of the curve; the 5th at the *end* of the curve; and the 6th in the *middle* of the curve (which is really more of a line at this point), on the edge of the arena. The remaining 4 curves behave identically to the previous 4 but on the other side of the arena.
      After the telegraphs are finished, fires the ice curves in the telegraphed order. Each curve represents a narrow [ms:line] [t:AoE] that inflicts [s:damage-down] to anyone in their path. The ice blocks they spawn are yet inactive, but approximately 7 seconds after an ice block spawns, it [explodes](a:sphere-shatter) in a large [ms:chariot] [t:AoE] that likewise inflicts [s:damage-down].
    resolve: |
      Determine which side of the arena the first curve appears on, then go *towards* that side, to the edge of the arena. Wait until after the *second* curve, then start chasing the curves until you end up just past the arrow on [boss]'s hitbox. Wait here until a curve cleaves the hitbox arrow, then plant yourself at the *end* of the hitbox arrow (opposite the tip). This spot is safe from every [a:sphere-shatter].

    description: |
      A tower appears at the front of the arena. [boss] then shoots six consecutive fireballs at it.
      If the tower is unsoaked, the fire [bathes the arena in flames](a:unmitigated-explosion) that deal heavy but survivable damage and inflict [s:vulnerability-up] and a stacking cleansable [s:burns-fail] [t:DoT].
      If the tower is soaked, deals heavy damage to the player to the tower and inflicts [s:fire-resistance-down-ii] and an uncleansable [s:burns-tb]. This damage can only realistically be survived by a tank with defensive cooldowns. Due to [s:fire-resistance-down-ii], soaking multiple consecutive hits is lethal.
      Even with a soaked tower, the fire still bathes the arena in flames. However, the flames are "split" down the middle by the player in the tower, creating a narrow conal safe spot behind that player. Note that players outside of this safe spot do **not** take survivable damage and a [s:vulnerability-up] and [s:burns] as it would be if the tower were left unsoaked; they just die.
      After each hit, [boss] repositions to the left, the middle, or the right. This has no bearing on the tower player but changes the angle of the safe cone for the other players.
    resolve: |
      Have one of your tanks soak the tower's first hit, then alternate tanks from there. The [s:fire-resistance-down-ii] only lasts for a single hit.
      For the first hit, [boss] is always positioned center. Afterwards, each hit requires the party to move such that the tower is between them and [boss].
      Note that using a tank [t:invuln] on multiple hits is inadvised, as the [s:fire-resistance-down-ii] from the first hit renders the next hit's [s:burns-tb] lethal. Additionally, the hits are spaced out just enough that an invuln cannot cover more than 2 hits. If you intend to invuln this tankbuster, make sure to time it as late as possible. If timed correctly, the invuln can cover two tower hits as well as the subsequent lethal [s:burns-tb] ticks, expiring just after the last [s:burns-tb] tick.
    tips:
      - As a non-tank, always move back to the middle after each hit; that way you only have to move either not at all or a maximum of 45 degrees. If you stay on the side after a hit, you may have to move a full 90 degrees, which is especially uncomfortable for casters.
      - As a tank, make sure to cycle through mitigation as needed. Don't save any mitigation for other tankbusters; the other tankbusters can all be comfortably survived with only a tank's short cooldown.

    resolve: |
      Use a predetermined starting position for both light parties in the center of the arena. The hitbox ring is a good indicator for where to start. After each hit, move *forward* until you reach the edge of the puddle. After the last hit, move sideways and wait for the puddles to dissipate.

      Heavy raidwide that initiates a mini-phase.
      During this mini-phase, [boss] becomes untargetable and instead spawns three targetable beacons: one flame-kissed beacon, one glacial beacon, and one thunderous beacon. The fight will not continue until all three beacons have been destroyed.
      Additionally, telegraphs a series of [conal AoEs](a:calamitous-echo) originating from the boss. All AoEs are evenly spaced. After each set of cones resolves, the next set of cones appears where the previous set *wasn't*.
      Finally, both healers are marked with [s:prey] and, after a short time, targeted by [a:calamitous-cry], a light party [m:stack.intercept]. After [a:calamitous-cry] resolves, [boss] is granted a stack of [s:damage-up], increasing the damage of the next [a:calamitous-cry] by 6% per stack. Subsequent [Calamitous Cries](a:calamitous-cry) alternate between targeting the tanks and healers.

      Being hit by one of the lines deals moderate damage and inflicts [s:deep-freeze].
    resolve: |
      While identifying a safe spot may seem daunting at first, the ice circles (and by extension the lines) appear in the same spots every time. The only variation is that they may be horizontally mirrored. This means that one of two spots will always be safe. You can find those spots and place a waymark in each spot to make resolving this mechanic much easier. Check the diagram for a visualization.

      Drops a feather on each non-levitating square.
      Each feather drop deals moderate proximity damage, starting in the square on the west and moving counter-clockwise, or starting in the square on the east and moving clockwise.
      Feathers become targetable after being dropped. After [a:hail-of-feathers], executes [a:blighted-bolt] which hits all feathers with a lightning strike that kills any players on the same square as the feather, and also hits all [levitating](s:levitate) players.
    resolve: |
      Move opposite the first feather, then rotate around the front of the arena. (Feathers always rotate around the rear first.) Stop in the rear corner next to the first feather, then kill the first feather and stand on its square while [a:blighted-bolt] resolves. Make sure you're not [levitating](s:levitate).
    tips:
      - If you're a melee, do not attempt to maintain melee uptime on the last feather impact unless you know what you're doing. The proximity damage has a steep falloff and you will likely die.
