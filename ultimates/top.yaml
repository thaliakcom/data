  2911:  # Damage Down
    type: impairment
    duration: 180000
    description: |
      Reduces all damage dealt by 90%.
      Due to the tight nature of this fight's DPS checks, it is paramount that this debuff is avoided at all costs. If that is not possible, consider [walling](t:wall) yourself to replace [s:2911] with [s:weakness], which only has a 100s duration and only reduces damage by 25%.
      Under no circumstances should you use any kind of damage cooldown while [s:2911] is active, even during the 2m buff window.

      Inflicted by certain attacks or mechanics. If the stack counter reaches 2, this debuff will turn into an uncleansable [s:doom], consigning that player to certain death.
      Generally inflicted by mechanics with multiple steps where each step is intended to be handled by a different player, like [a:program-loop]. Unlike [s:magic-vuln], this debuff cannot be cheesed through the use of mitigation or [invulns](t:invuln).
      **Be aware that the counter stacks with [s:thrice-come-ruin].** Therefore, accruing [s:twice-come-ruin:1] and [s:thrice-come-ruin:1] will also lead to death.

      If a player accrues 3 stacks of this condition, it will turn into [s:doom] and they will die.
      **Be aware that the counter stacks with [s:twice-come-ruin].** Therefore, accruing [s:twice-come-ruin:1] and [s:thrice-come-ruin:1] will also lead to death.

    description: |
      A major mechanic revolving around towers and tethers.
      Inflicts the following effects:
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (16s) and [s:first-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (25s) and [s:second-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (34s) and [s:third-in-line]
      * 2 random players with [s:looper] (43s) and [s:fourth-in-line]
      Then spawns two towers and two tethers originating from the boss and begins casting [a:blaster-cast]. The tethers can be passed between players by moving through them.
      Each tower must be soaked by exactly one player with the [s:looper] effect. Towers ignore players without this effect. Soaking a tower inflicts [s:twice-come-ruin] and resolves [s:looper] for that player; if [s:looper] is allowed to expire on its own, the player will be inflicted with [s:memory-loss] and likely [t:wall] themselves.
      The [a:blaster] tethers release a massive blast roughly the size of the boss's hitbox around the tethered players. The tethered players, as well as anyone else hit by the explosion, are inflicted with [s:hp-penalty] and [s:twice-come-ruin].
      This mechanic then repeats three more times. Note the following:
      * Tethers don't disappear after [a:blaster] resolves; they remain on whichever players last had them until the fourth set resolves.
      * The next set of towers spawns in a translucent state even before the current set has resolved.
      * There are, in total, 8 possible locations for towers to spawn (2 per cardinal, slightly offset from that cardinal to either side).
      * A tower cannot spawn in a location it has already spawned before. In some cases this allows you to predict where the next set of towers is going to spawn even before they appear.
      * Towers can never spawn on both positions of the same cardinal.
    resolve: |
      As each [s:twice-come-ruin] stack lasts for exactly 1 full turn of the mechanic, there is only one order to resolve the mechanic in:
      Turn 1: [s:first-in-line] soaks towers, [s:third-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 2: [s:second-in-line] soaks towers, [s:fourth-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 3: [s:third-in-line] soaks towers, [s:first-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      Turn 4: [s:fourth-in-line] soaks towers, [s:second-in-line] takes tethers and brings them to an empty cardinal.
      In other words: after resolving your tower or tether, you do nothing for a turn, then the next turn your role is whichever role you haven't had yet.
      Since there are always two players assigned to each mechanic, it is *strongly recommended* to use a priority system to determine who takes which tower/tether (and, in the case of tethers, where to bring that tether as well). If you're using Party Finder, check with your Data Center's Ultimate Discord to learn what priority system your Data Center uses. For example, LPDU (Light) uses M1/M2/MT/OT/R1/R2/H1/H2 where, if you are to the left of your partner in that list, you take the clockwise tower/tether starting from north, and if you are to the right of your partner in that list, you take the counter-clockwise tower/tether starting from north. As a result, M1 always goes clockwise no matter what, and H2 always goes counter-clockwise no matter what.
    tips:
      - If you forget which turn it is or what your job on this turn is, check your debuffs. If your [s:looper] debuff is about to expire, it's your turn to take a tower. If your "x in line" debuff and [s:looper] debuffs are gone and you have a [s:twice-come-ruin] stack that is about to expire or has already expired, it's your turn to take a tether. If your [s:hp-penalty] expires and you're suddenly on 1% HP, it's your turn to take a tower (unless [a:program-loop] has already concluded).
      - It is recommended to manually sort your party list so that the players you need to look at to determine your priority are at the very top. For example, using the LPDU priority described above, R1 would move the R2, H1, and H2 players to the top of their party list. If any of them have the same number, the R1 player would move clockwise; otherwise they would move counter-clockwise.
      - Taking your tether max melee in your designated empty cardinal is far enough to avoid hitting players on the tower cardinals, allowing you to keep full uptime on the boss.
      - After your tether is resolved, don't immediately beeline for the nearest tower cardinal. Instead, go slightly inside the hitbox so that any non-tether players can make their way past you, then wait until the next tether player has taken their tether from you before moving into a safe spot.
      - Never move directly through the center of the boss's hitbox, as you will likely steal someone else's tether and cause a wipe.
      - Since towers completely ignore players without [s:looper], after you resolve your tower, you can then stand in any tower you wish while waiting for your [s:twice-come-ruin] to expire.
      - Healers must heal the [s:third-in-line] and [s:fourth-in-line] players after their [s:hp-penalty] expires, as they'll die from [a:storage-violation] otherwise. Tanks can help by using targeted mitigation like [a:tbn] or [a:heart-of-corundum].
      - After the Program Loop cast, Omega does one more auto-attack before beginning the [a:blaster-cast] cast, at which point Omega's position and rotation is locked in for the remainder of the mechanic. It can be helpful to turn the boss to the southwest or southeast (depending on where your melees are in your priority order) before the [a:blaster-cast] cast begins, to give your melees easy access to positionals.
    mistakes:
      - Miscounting or forgetting your turn.
      - Ignoring or forgetting the priority and not adjusting.
      - Moving while passing off a tether. (This increases the likelihood of other players passing through the tether and being unable to take it.)
      - Rotating the wrong way and stealing someone else's tether.

      Deals medium damage to the tethered players and all players in a large radius around them and inflicts [s:hp-penalty] and [s:twice-come-ruin].
      Be aware that [s:hp-penalty] reduces max HP only *after* the damage is dealt; if a player's HP reaches 0 from the initial hit, their max HP won't be reduced; they'll just die. However, in general it should not be necessary to heal these players before they take their hit unless there are significant gear problems or they forgot to eat food.

      Major mechanic with high movement and healing requirements.
      Inflicts the following effects on players:
      * 2 random players with [s:guided-missile] (12s), [s:first-in-line], and [s:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios] (24s)
      * 2 random players with [s:guided-missile] (18s), [s:second-in-line], and [s:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios] (30s)
      * 2 random players with [s:guided-missile] (24s), [s:third-in-line], and [s:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios] (12s)
      * 2 random players with [s:guided-missile] (30s), [s:fourth-in-line], and [s:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios] (18s)
      Next, Omega telegraphs two wide [a:flame-thrower] conal AoEs on two random opposite positions. A few seconds later, a telegraphed [a:ballistic-impact] puddle appears underneath each player. [a:flame-thrower] resolves first, then rotates either clockwise or counter-clockwise in 2 second intervals until the mechanic is complete. [a:ballistic-impact] resolves half a second later, and from then on spawns new puddles underneath each player every 2 seconds until the mechanic is complete as well.
      Additionally, the status effects on players will expire and execute their respective mechanic. [a:guided-missile-kyrios] is a spread [ms:chariot] that knocks any other players hit into the wall. [a:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios] is a [ms:line] originating from Omega that must be shared with 3 other players to avoid dealing lethal damage.

      Like [a:program-loop], the debuff assignment is completely random and thus requires a priority system to handle. The flamethrower cones leave two safe spots for groups to assemble; each group must have only unique "x in line" debuffs amongst its members. As a caveat, both groups will likely be outside of the other group's healing range, so it's essential that each group features one healer. As such, a priority system like the following (LPDU) presents itself: MT/M1/R1/H1 for group 1, and OT/M2/R2/H2 for group 2 where, if duplicate "x in line" debuffs exist within the group, the leftmost member in this priority list swaps to the other group.
      As for where to place each group, it is most common to start group 1 north and group 2 south (or west/east) and rotate each group clockwise if the flamethrower cones happen to point directly north and south (or east/west).
      Like [a:program-loop], this mechanic has four turns. During each turn, the respective [s:guided-missile] player must separate from the group to take their [a:guided-missile-kyrios] alone, while the rest of the group must remain stacked to soak [a:condensed-wave-cannon-kyrios].
      There are two main ways of making this happen, see the strategies below.
    tips:
      - Avoid gapclosers or dashes. They make movement unpredictable and may cause you to drop a puddle in an inopportune location.
      - Due to how fast the mechanic moves, healers don't have the luxury of long-casting AoE heals here. However, there is no other healing-intense mechanic until Phase 3, so both the party and the healers should aim to use every single mitigation and healing cooldown they have during this mechanic.
      - When moving out for your [a:guided-missile-kyrios] (especially if you're a caster), consider using [a:sprint] to be able to place your puddles more accurately and return to the party in time.
    mistakes:
      - Forgetting your turn and bombing the party (especially common for [s:first-in-line]).
      - Ignoring or forgetting the priority and not adjusting.
      - Improper puddle placements (e.g. placing a puddle directly in the party's way while coming back after your [a:guided-missile-kyrios]).

Make sure the four players assigned to Omega-M are *on or inside Omega-M's hitbox*, or they may be selected for Omega-F instead. The players assigned to Omega-F can be anywhere in the arena (as long as they're not on or inside Omega-M's hitbox), but should probably be close to Omega-F's hitbox to ensure they're in range for raid buffs.

    description: |
      Omega-M and Omega-F disappear and tether each player to another player, inflicting either [s:mid-glitch] or [s:remote-glitch] on all players, and show a matching PlayStation headmarker above all players and their partners.
      Omega-M and Omega-F then reappear and prepare a deadly AoE combination. Each of them also spawns a *fake* clone of themselves that does nothing and merely serves to misdirect players. The true and fake copies each follow a set of strict rules that makes identifying the true bosses simple:
      * The true Omega-M will always spawn between a cardinal and an intercardinal, and will always face the true Omega-F.
      * The true Omega-F will always spawn opposite the true Omega-M (i.e. also between a cardinal and an intercardinal), and will always face him.
      * The fake Omega-M will always spawn in the center of the arena and will always wield a sword (without a shield).
      * The fake Omega-F will always spawn on a cardinal or intercardinal, and will always wield a staff.
      The true Omega-M's and Omega-F's stances and weapons indicate which attack each will use:
      * Omega-F with a staff: a plus-shaped AoE in the direction she is facing ([a:optimized-blizzard-iii])
      * Omega-F with blade legs: cleaves her sides, leaving a safe line toward Omega-M ([a:superliminal-steel])
      * Omega-M with a sword: a [ms:chariot] AoE on his position ([a:efficient-bladework])
      * Omega-F with a sword and shield: a [ms:dynamo] AoE on his position ([a:beyond-strength])
      While this is happening, a massive synthetic eye (Optical Unit) spawns on a random cardinal or intercardinal outside the arena. Some time after Omega-M and Omega-F have executed their respective AoEs, this eye will fire a deadly [a:optical-laser] line AoE through the center of the arena. At the same time, [a:optimized-fire-iii] (a [ms:chariot] [m:spread]) resolves on each player. This AoE is deadly if the correct distance between each tethered pair (defined by [s:mid-glitch] or [s:remote-glitch]) is not maintained.
      Finally, Omega-F appears in the center of the arena while 5 clones of Omega-M appear close to the edge of the arena. Two random players are marked with stacks, Omega-F executes a knockback from the center, and all Omega-Ms execute a large [ms:chariot] AoE from their position. There are always 3 Omega-Ms spawning directly beside one another, with a gap between every other Omega-M.
      If your party is still alive at this point, [s:mid-glitch]/[s:remote-glitch] expires, and the Omega-M that is sandwiched between the two other Omega-Ms, and the Omega-F in the center become targetable again and the next mechanical sequence commences.
    resolve: |
      While Party Synergy is casting, preposition yourselves into 2 [t:conga line]s (one per light party) or one big conga line for the whole party. There must always be 4 players per [a:optical-laser] side, and two tethered players cannot be on the same side, so if any tether pair is in the same group, one of them (usually the southmost one) adjusts to the other group.
      With groups settled, it now becomes time to identify the true Omega-F and Omega-M and their combined safe spot. There are many ways to go about finding the correct bosses, but the simplest way is to find the Omega-M who is *not* in the center of the arena. The Omega-F he is facing is the true Omega-F.
      The following safe spots are possible:
      * staff + sword: stay away from Omega-M and Omega-F (be careful not to be on Omega-F's sides; ideally just stick close but not too close to Omega-M's sides)
      * staff + shield: only Omega-M's sides are safe
      * blade legs + sword: stack on Omega-F
      * blade legs + shield: stack on Omega-M
      Note that there is not enough time to raise anyone, so if anyone dies during this step the mechanic is no longer resolvable and a wipe is all but guaranteed.
      While moving into the safe spot (or after moving into the safe spot), find the Optical Unit on the outside of the arena. This eye will be the new north for the duration of the mechanic. Note that the eye emits a directional sound when it spawns, which can make locating it easier.
      All group 1 players position themselves throughout the arena on the eye's left side (west), while all group 2 players position themselves throughout the arena on the eye's right side (east). Use the PlayStation headmarkers you received at the start of the mechanic to determine your final position. Most groups opt for (from closest to the eye to farthest from the eye): [i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle] (also known as BPOG – blue, purple, orange, green).
      Note that the positions must be adjusted based on [s:mid-glitch] or [s:remote-glitch].
      For [s:mid-glitch], stand close to but not right next to the [a:optical-laser] line. Note that the line is not telegraphed, so it is recommended to use arena markers to position yourself. For instance, with the standard LPDU markers, the correct distance is on the inside of the markers that are right next to [a:optical-laser] (see the diagram).
      For [s:remote-glitch], stand at the edge of the arena. Be aware that the tether must be stretched to almost the full diameter of the arena, which means group 2 must invert their positions if it's [s:remote-glitch] (so they would use [i:triangle][i:circle][i:square][i:cross] instead of [i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle]).
      Wait until the AoEs go off, then check both yourself and your partner to see if either of you have one of the stack markers. Each stack deals lethal damage if not taken with exactly 4 players, so equal groups must be reestablished – reestablished because it is not guaranteed that both stacks target players on opposite sides. If there are two stacks in the same group/side, one of them (usually the southmost one) **and their tether partner** must swap groups. This is why it is important to look at your partner. If there are two stacks per side and either you or your partner have the southmost one, both of you must swap sides.
      Identify the three Omega-Ms in a row and orient yourself toward them. If you're in group 1 and you're looking at the three side-by-side clones, you must always be knocked into the safe spot to your left. If you're in group 2, you must either be knocked back into the safe spot on your right (if it's [s:remote-glitch]) or the safe spot behind you (if it's [s:mid-glitch]). This knockback cannot be negated. There is, however, enough time after the knockback for slight position adjustments, so precision is not required here.
    tips:
      - Look around to find the eye after moving into the safe spot for the initial AoEs. You should already know where the eye is after the AoEs have resolved.
      - The eye makes an audible directional sound when it spawns, which can be used to pinpoint its location without looking.
      - Use [a:sprint] to make it to your [a:optimized-fire-iii] spot in time in case you were late to find the eye, or your spot happens to be on the opposite side of the arena from the initial AoE safe spot.
      - The initial AoEs make a return in [a:run-dynamis-(omega-version)], so this mechanic can be used to practice the dodges.
    mistakes:
      - Failing to identify the safe spot in time.
      - Failing to find the eye in time and being late to your [a:optimized-fire-iii] spot.
      - "[s:mid-glitch]: improperly judging the distance."
      - "[s:remote-glitch] as group 2: forgetting to invert your position from [i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle] to [i:triangle][i:circle][i:square][i:cross]."
      - "After [a:optimized-fire-iii]: not checking your partner for the stack marker to see if you have to swap groups."

      Once tethers spawn, tanks should grab the tethers and move to the edge of the arena, slightly *clockwise* of their respective clone. If done correctly, the tankbusters leave a gap in the form of a narrow line through the center in which the party can stack.
      Consequently, after tanks have grabbed their tethers, the party should immediately move into the center of the arena, right on top of Omega-M. Do *not* wait for the [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] telegraph to appear as it has already snapshot its position.
      If the [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] clone spawned behind or in front of the party, the center may not be safe. In this case, wait for the telegraph to appear, then move slightly towards one of the two [a:optimized-bladedance] clones, just enough to get out of the AoE.
      Afterwards, two previously designated party members (usually the tanks) should move in-between the party and the Omega-M clone with the [a:synthetic-shield] at [t:max melee] to intercept [a:beyond-defense]. Whichever of these two players is targeted should immediately circle around the party, ending up on the opposite side so they cannot be targeted for or hit by [a:pile-pitch], which is lethal to that player. The other player should move in to stack with the party for [a:pile-pitch]. It is okay for the [a:beyond-defense] baiters to also be targeted for [a:optimized-meteor].
      The intended way to resolve [a:optimized-meteor] is to have these players move out of the [a:pile-pitch] party stack, but with sufficient shielding and mitigation the [a:optimized-meteor] players can just stack with the party. This has become the preferred way to handle this mechanic in most parties.
      Remember to heal up and mitigate for [a:cosmo-meteor], then it's just DPS until both bosses are dead.
    tips:
      - The angle of [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] snapshots when the corresponding Omega-M begins the animation. Therefore you can move out of it immediately, without having to wait for the AoE telegraph to appear.
      - If you're a ranged player, you can safely move to the edge of the arena if targeted by [a:optimized-meteor] to reduce the damage taken by the party. However, be mindful of the shielded Omega-M and do not move to the edge closest to him, or you may bait [a:beyond-defense], which will make it impossible to escape the follow-up [a:pile-pitch]. If you're a melee player with [a:optimized-meteor], do not move to max melee; this will not meaningfully decrease the flare damage and only serves to increase the damage the party takes from [a:pile-pitch] (since there's now one less player in the stack).
      - If the [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] clone spawns directly behind or in front of the party (thus shooting the line through the middle), check the positions of the [a:optimized-bladedance] and their tethers. Try to dodge **perpendicular** to those tethers after the tanks have taken them to the edge.
      - If you "randomly" die, [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] may be to blame. Anyone standing in [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow] when the AoE telegraph disappears are already dead, but they don't actually die until the arrow firing animation has completely finished.
    mistakes:
      - Tanks greeding for uptime and not moving to the edge in time (thus tankbustering the entire party).
      - Tanks not properly communicating whether they'll take their tether to the clockwise or counter-clockwise edge and leaving no safe spot for the party.
      - In the attempt to avoid [a:optimized-sagittarius-arrow], dodging directly into [a:optimized-bladedance].
      - The player who was targeted by [a:beyond-defense] not moving around the party stack in time to avoid being one of the closest 2 players to the clone and taking the follow-up [a:pile-pitch].

      - As a general rule of thumb, if Omega-F's healthbar reaches the "O" in her name *before* the castbar reaches the "o" in "Laser Shower", you're on track for DPS. If the castbar reaches the "o" first, you're behind on DPS and should consider using some of your cooldowns to kill Omega-F in time.

      3 mechanical hands spawn close to the outside of the arena, then another 3 hands spawn in-between them. Each hand emits a telegraphed [a:colossal-blow] about 12 seconds after it spawns.
    resolve: |
      The entire party should organize into a [t:conga line] to the south. Each Data Center's Party Finder may use a different line-up order, but the actual order makes no difference for the mechanic. LPDU uses R1/M1/MT/H1/H2/OT/M2/R2.
      Look at your debuffs. Once debuffs come out, take a step back if you get [s:sniper-cannon-fodder], take a step forward if you get [s:high-powered-sniper-cannon-fodder], and stay put if you get nothing. Wait until everyone there are 2 people in your new line (as nothing or [s:high-powered-sniper-cannon-fodder]) or 4 people (as [s:sniper-cannon-fodder]). Whichever position you are in this new line-up determines your position (see the diagram).
      Stay out of the first [a:colossal-blow], then step into both it and the preceding [a:wave-repeater] hit. The sniper cannons resolve at the same time as the second set of [a:colossal-blow], greatly limiting the available safe spots. This means that if anyone is out of position, there is no longer enough space to resolve the mechanic without deaths.
    tips:
      - It is not necessary to pay attention to which set of hands spawns first. As long as you stand centered in-between the 2 closest hands, you'll always have enough time to step out of the first AoE. [a:sprint] makes this even easier.
    mistakes:
      - Not stepping out of the [t:conga line] in time and confusing your party members.
      - If you're a [s:high-powered-sniper-cannon-fodder], not checking to make sure you're stacking with a no-debuff player, and vice-versa.

      Heavy raidwide that begins the next major mechanic.
      Please note that, while this mechanic is technically quite complicated, resolving it is actually quite simple. If reading all the technical specifications on how the mechanic works confuses you, try skipping to the "Resolve" section below.
      Inflicts the following debuffs on all players:
      * [s:local-code-smell] (2×23s, 2×44s, 2×65s, 2×86s)
      * [s:remote-code-smell] (2×23s, 2×44s, 2×65s, 2×86s)
      * [s:latent-synchronization-bug] (8×69s)
      The 2 [s:local-code-smell] players with a duration of 23s are also inflicted with [s:latent-defect].
      Also inflicts each of the following debuffs on 2 random players:
      * [s:overflow-code-smell] and either [s:underflow-code-smell] or [s:performance-code-smell]
      * [s:synchronization-code-smell] and either [s:performance-code-smell] or [s:underflow-code-smell]
      All of these gray debuffs are considered "inactive" and do not yet have an effect. After they expire, they turn into:
      * [s:local-code-smell] → [s:local-regression]
      * [s:remote-code-smell] → [s:remote-regression]
      * [s:overflow-code-smell] → [s:critical-overflow-bug]
      * [s:synchronization-code-smell] → [s:critical-synchronization-bug]
      * [s:underflow-code-smell] → [s:critical-underflow-bug]
      * [s:performance-code-smell] → [s:critical-performance-bug]
      Omega then spawns 4 large towers (2 blue, 2 red) around the arena and begins casting [a:latent-defect]. The towers always spawn on either cardinals or intercardinals. Towers with the same colour can never spawn opposite each other, only adjacent.
      At the end of the cast, all towers and critical bug debuffs resolve, causing a wipe if any towers are left unsoaked or any critical bugs are resolved incorrectly (more on how to resolve them correctly later). This is also where all 4 currently inactive tethers become active and can now break.
      Additionally, the blue towers inflict [s:latent-performance-defect] on all players inside, and the red towers [s:cascading-latent-defect]. Both are 10 second debuffs that resolve when [s:critical-performance-bug] and [s:critical-underflow-bug], respectively, expire. If a defect is allowed to expire on its own, the party wipes. In other words: if a player soaks a blue tower without [s:critical-performance-bug], or if a player soaks a red tower without [s:critical-underflow-bug], the party wipes 10 seconds later.
      In addition to (potentially) resolving [s:latent-performance-defect] or [s:cascading-latent-defect], each critical bug (if resolved correctly) turns into one of the following buffs:
      * [s:critical-overflow-bug] → [s:overflow-debugger]
      * [s:critical-synchronization-bug] → [s:synchronization-debugger]
      * [s:critical-underflow-bug] → [s:underflow-debugger]
      * [s:critical-performance-bug] → [s:performance-debugger]
      Each debugger renders the player immune to this type of critical bug for the remainder of the mechanic, even if they fulfill the conditions for being inflicted with it again.
      Omega repeats [a:latent-defect] 4 times, then casts [a:critical-error] at the end, a heavy raidwide that inflicts all players with all critical bugs again – unless they have the corresponding debugger. Critical bugs are only resolvable during [a:hello-world], so all players must have all 4 debuggers during [a:critical-error] or a wipe is guaranteed.
      Each critical bug can be passed to other players in some way:
      * [s:critical-overflow-bug]: a huge [ms:defamation] type AoE that inflicts [s:critical-overflow-bug] to anyone else hit by it.
      * [s:critical-synchronization-bug]: a small 2-man stack that inflicts [s:critical-synchronization-bug] to anyone else in the stack.
      * [s:critical-underflow-bug]: a [st:rot] that inflicts [s:critical-underflow-bug] to anyone coming into contact with this player. Explodes in a small AoE at the end of its duration.
      * [s:critical-performance-bug]: a [st:rot] that inflicts [s:critical-performance-bug] to anyone coming into contact with this player. Explodes in a small AoE at the end of its duration.
    resolve: |
      While the mechanic seems complicated, the debuffs applied at the start ensure that there is only one way to resolve the mechanic correctly.
      First, in this description, the following terms will be used instead of the full ability names:
      * [s:critical-overflow-bug] will be called "defamation".
      * [s:critical-synchronization-bug] will be called "stack".
      * [s:critical-underflow-bug] will be called "red rot".
      * [s:critical-performance-bug] will be called "blue rot".
      * [s:local-regression] will be called "red-green tether".
      * [s:remote-regression] will be called "blue tether".
      At the start of the mechanic, the party should position itself in a loose spread (ideally at clock spots) to avoid accidentally passing rots. Next, look at the party's debuffs and find a player with [s:critical-overflow-bug]. If that player has [s:critical-underflow-bug], *red* is the "[ms:defamation] colour". If that player has [s:critical-performance-bug], *blue* is the "[ms:defamation] colour". Remember this colour, as it doesn't change throughout the whole mechanic.
      The first red-green tether players always have [s:latent-defect], requiring them to be hit by [a:critical-overflow-bug] (defamation). Thus, the following order of operations establishes itself, which remains the same throughout all 4 [a:latent-defect]s:
      **Step 1:**
      * Red rots go to red towers.
      * Blue rots go to blue towers.
      * All tower players either stand at max melee if their tower is the defamation tower, or at the edge of their tower closest to the other tower if it isn't.
      * The blue tether players stand in-between the non-defamation towers, each stacking with one of the players inside those towers.
      * The red tether players each stand just outside of a defamation tower in-between a defamation tower and a non-defamation tower. Try to stand just outside the hitbox to avoid being clipped by the other defamation.
      **Step 2:**
      * [a:latent-defect] resolves.
      * Tower players get [s:synchronization-debugger] or [s:overflow-debugger].
      * Blue tether players get [s:critical-synchronization-bug] and red-green tether players get [s:critical-overflow-bug].
      **Step 3:**
      * Red-green tether players move on top of their respective tower players to receive their rot.
      * Blue tether players wait half a GCD for [s:magic-vuln] to expire, then move on top of their respective tower players to receive their rot. This automatically breaks their tether.
      * Red-green tether players wait a GCD or two for the blue tether's [s:stacking-magic-vuln:2] to expire, then move toward each other to break their own tether.
      * After this, make sure to **stay away from the previous tower players** as their rot will shortly explode and kill anyone nearby.
      These steps repeat for every [a:latent-defect]. However, the *last* [a:latent-defect] has a slight variation: instead of red-green tether players going to the defamation towers, they instead pretend they're blue tether players and stack on top of a blue tether player. This is because, at this point, both of these players should already have [s:overflow-debugger], so there is no reason to be hit by defamation again, and it makes more sense for these players to help soak the stack.
      If done correctly, all 8 players should have all 4 debuggers at the end of the mechanic.
    tips:
      - Each [a:latent-defect] set has 3 instances of heavy raidwide damage. Therefore, properly planning out your mitigation and healing is essential to survive this mechanic.
      - Outside of the [a:latent-defect] casts, the boss is constantly auto-attacking the main tank for over 30k damage per auto during the entire mechanic. There are no tankbusters until Phase 5, so make sure to use all your personal mitigation during this phase (except for your invuln). Off-tanks and healers should try to help the main tank as well. You may even want to consider a tankswap at some point during the mechanic.
      - It is very easy to accidentally pass rot while moving to your tower. To avoid this, rots should always move outside the hitbox, and tethers should always move inside the hitbox. Be aware of healers, who may have to go into the hitbox to heal (while also having rot).
      - Timing is extremely important during this mechanic. Rots must be passed within 1 or at most 2 GCDs of the towers resolving. If passed too early or too late, [s:cascading-latent-defect]/[s:latent-performance-defect] will expire, causing a wipe.
      - Timing is also extremely important for the tether breaks. Avoid breaking a tether while [s:magic-vuln] or [s:stacking-magic-vuln:2] is still active. It won't cause a wipe but will deal significantly increased damage which healers may not be prepared to heal.
    mistakes:
      - Colliding with another player and passing rot unintentionally.
      - Passing or taking rot too late, causing [s:latent-performance-defect] or [s:cascading-latent-defect] to expire before the rot and wiping the party.
      - Being mid-movement while attempting to pass your rot. (Similar to [a:blaster] tethers, this increases the likelihood of rot not being passed.)
      - Snapping both tethers at the same time.
      - Snapping a tether too late.
      - Forgetting which set of towers are the [s:critical-overflow-bug] towers and which the [s:critical-synchronization-bug] towers.
      - Forgetting to count which set of [a:latent-defect] it is and therefore forgetting to take the last red-green tether to the [s:critical-synchronization-bug] towers instead of the [s:critical-overflow-bug] towers (therefore consuming your [s:overflow-debugger], getting another set of [s:critical-overflow-bug] during [a:critical-error] and wiping the party).
    trivia: |
      This mechanic uses various programming terms for its submechanics, such as:
      * *Hello World*: a simple program that just prints "Hello World" to the console. One of the most common examples used to teach beginners the syntax of a new programming language.
      * *Code Smell*: any kind of code that is considered "bad" by modern programming standards, often violating agreed upon best practices. Can often result in subtle, hard-to-diagnose bugs.
      * *Overflow*/*underflow*: before storing a number in a variable, you have to first define the "size" of that variable (i.e. how big the numbers that you're storing in it can be). This size determines how much memory the variable takes up. If you try to store a too-large number in a too-small variable, the number *overflows* (meaning that it wraps back around to 0). *Underflow* is the opposite of that, when you try to store a too-small number in a too-small variable (for instance trying to store a negative value in a variable that can only store positive values).
      * *Debugger*: tool used to step through code one line at a time and inspect the values of each variable at runtime. Useful for diagnosing bugs.

      Monitors appear on either the left or right side of Omega as well as the left or right side of three random players (through [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading]).
      At the end of the cast all monitors resolve, hitting two random players on the indicated side with large [ms:chariot] AoEs that inflict [s:magic-vuln] and [s:twice-come-ruin].
    resolve: |
      As there are 4 sets of monitors which hit 2 players each, each player is allowed to only receive one monitor AoE. To accomplish this, first identify whether Omega's east or west is the monitor side. Only 2 players should be on that side. All other players should be on the non-monitor side, where the three monitor players must position and rotate themselves in such a way that there are only 2 players on each of *their* monitor side as well. This removes the randomness from the mechanic.
      Note that the [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading] can (and must!) themselves receive an [a:oversampled-wave-cannon] hit.
      Check the diagram for an example of how LPDU handles this mechanic.
      Be aware that attacking the boss with anything but an auto-attack will briefly turn your character, so consider staying idle at the end of the cast if you're an [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading] player.
    tips:
      - The snapshot for which players are targeted by the monitors is unforgiving. **Do not greed for uptime** if you have [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading].
    mistakes:
      - Forgetting which non-monitor/monitor player goes where.
      - Greeding for uptime and targeting the wrong players with [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading].
      - Angling your monitors, thus targeting the wrong players.
      - Not being spread far enough apart and cleaving someone else with your monitor AoE.

          Players line up in a [t:conga line] from north to south on the boss's west side in the following order: H1, H2, M1, M2, M1, M2, R1, R2
          Each player now counts their position only amongst players with the same responsibility, i.e. [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading] players ignore non-monitor players and only count their position amongst the other monitor players from 1–3, and non-monitor players only count amongst non-monitor players (from 1–5).
          * Monitor 1 goes to the non-boss-monitor side and centers themselves inside the 1/4 marker, facing their monitor towards the east (if on the east side) or west (if on the west side).
          * Monitor 2 goes to the boss monitor side and aligns themselves with the **south** edge of the 1/4 marker, facing their monitor north.
          * Monitor 3 goes to the boss monitor side and aligns themselves with the **north** edge of the 2/3 marker, facing their monitor south.
          All non-monitor players position themselves on the non-boss-monitor side.
          * Non-monitor 1 positions themselves max melee above the A marker (north).
          * Non-monitor 2 positions themselves max melee between 1 and B (or 4 and D).

      3 sets of spreads followed by stacks.
      During the cast, line stack markers appear on 2 random players. However, before these resolve, Omega first fires lasers at all 8 players that deal moderate damage, inflict [s:magic-vuln], and leave behind an "afterimage" that resolves at the same time as the stacks 5 seconds later.
      This mechanic repeats three times until [boss] begins casting its enrage, [a:blue-screen].
      After the first set, [boss] also fires out [a:wave-repeater].
    resolve: |
      **Ignore the line stack markers when they appear.** Do not get baited by the line stack markers – the first mechanic that resolves is the [a:wave-cannon-spread]. Wait until they have gone off, then stack in two groups. *Do not stack somewhere a player resolved a protean laser before.*
      A good idea is to leave the south safe for the stacks and have 4 players spread on the west and 4 players on the east. If one of these two 4-player groups has 2 stacks, the southern stack should swap alongside the southmost player of the other group.
      Remember to dodge [a:wave-repeater]. In general, a good strategy is to resolve the stacks and spreads within the ring just outside Omega's hitbox, then quickly step into the inner ring once [a:wave-repeater] hits there, and go back once [a:wave-repeater] has hit the outer ring.
      **It is strongly recommended to use [i:melee] LB3 at the start of this phase** or the DPS check is close to impossible.
    mistakes:
      - Forgetting to swap sides as the second stack on a given side.
      - Forgetting to swap sides if you're the first player on a given side and your side has no stacks. (A 3-player stack results in lethal damage.)
      - Forgetting to move in and being hit by [a:wave-repeater].
      - Not moving back to your designated spot in time and baiting a [a:wave-cannon-lines] in the wrong location (on top of a stack).

    description: |
      Heavy raidwide that initiates the first of three [trios](t:trio).
      After the raidwide, Omega-M becomes untargetable and tethers all players to another player: two pairs via [s:remote-code-smell] and two pairs via [s:local-code-smell]. Additionally, one player is inflicted with [s:hello-near-world] and one player with [s:hello-distant-world]. At the same time, Beetle Omega and Final Omega spawn on two random opposite cardinals, and an Optical Unit on one of the two remaining cardinals.
      Multiple things now happen at the same time:
      **Fists**
      After some time, untargetable Rocket Punch fists spawn on top of every player. There will be 4 fists with blue lights and 4 fists with yellow lights. All [s:remote-code-smell] players are guaranteed to get exactly 2 blue fists and 2 yellow fists between them, but the exact distribution is random. Same with [s:local-code-smell] players. Each fist "belongs" to the player it spawned on, but the fists stay in place after they spawn. Approximately 11 seconds after they spawn (2 seconds after the tethers become active), the fists jump towards the player they belong to. If this player is stacked with a player of the opposite-coloured fist, [a small puddle](a:explosion) appears as the fists smash into each other and harmlessly explode, otherwise the fist [smashes the ground and wipes the raid](a:unmitigated-explosion).
      **Arms**
      Shortly after the fists initially spawn, one Arm Unit spawns near the Optical Unit, one directly opposite, and four more spawn 60° offset from the first two for a total of six. Each Arm Unit is either a Left Arm Unit or a Right Arm Unit, denoted by the rotating arrow marker (blue/counter-clockwise arrows for Left; yellow/clockwise arrows for Right). A few seconds after the fists resolve, each arm snapshots towards the closest player to that arm and, after a brief delay, begins firing a [a:hyper-pulse] where that player was that then rotates in the indicated direction.
      **Optical Unit**
      The Optical Unit fires an [a:optical-laser] (same as the one during [a:party-synergy]) through the middle of the arena at the same time as the fists resolve.
      **Omega-M**
      Shortly before fists resolve, Omega-M spawns in the center of the arena and, shortly *after* fists resolve, targets one of the two closest players to him with [a:beyond-defense], and then the closest player after that with [a:pile-pitch].
      **Monitors**
      After the fists resolve, a random [s:remote-regression] (blue tether) player is inflicted with [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading], showing monitors on either side of them. Final Omega also prepares monitors on either its left or right. Both sets of monitors resolve at the same time as [a:pile-pitch].
      **Beetle**
      After all other mechanics are resolved, Beetle Omega begins to cast [a:swivel-cannon], indicated by the blue lights on either side of it, significantly limiting the amount of space available to resolve [s:hello-near-world] and [s:hello-distant-world], which resolve shortly after.
      **Hello, Near/Distant World**
      Represents the main mechanic of Phase 5. [a:hello-near-distant-world:d]
      Be aware that if a player with [s:hello-near-world] or [s:hello-distant-world] dies, [all players are killed instantly](a:hello-world-fail).
    resolve: |
      There are many ways to handle this mechanic. Check the diagrams for some of the most common ways.
      The most important strat-agnostic things are:
      * Pair both red-green ([s:local-regression]) pairs and both blue ([s:remote-regression]) pairs with each other to resolve fists. Never pair different tether types with each other, as this may result in the fists all being the same colour and therefore unresolvable. If two fist-paired players have the same-coloured fist, simply swap with your tether partner and fists will be correctly resolved.
      * Don't be in the middle while resolving fists. A common strategy is to place both blue tethers on the Beetle side of the arena, and both red-green pairs on the Final Omega side.
      * You *can* combine fists with your tether partner if you both get opposite-coloured fists, but due to the distance requirements of the tethers this may make executing the rest of the mechanic more difficult and is therefore not recommended.
      * The Left/Right Arm Unit rotator indicator disappears *before the arm actually targets a player.* Do **not** move away from the arm as soon as the rotator indicator disappears; instead wait until the yellow line telegraph appears.
    mistakes:
      - Being mid-movement while the Rocket Punch fists snapshot. (This **always** causes [a:unmitigated-explosion], even if you're on top of a player with a differently coloured fist.)
      - As an arm unit baiter, moving to the incorrect side of your arm or not reaching the correct side in time, thus cleaving the entire arena.
      - As an arm baiter [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading] player, forgetting to use [a:sprint] and arriving too late to the middle to properly angle your monitor.
      - As the [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading] player, not moving far enough horizontally from the [a:pile-pitch] stack, thus causing one of the players in the stack to be targeted by [a:oversampled-wave-cannon] and wiping the party.
      - As a monitor baiter, not moving close enough to the wall and cleaving someone else with your AoE, especially on the non-monitor side (where you may cleave the [a:beyond-defense] player who had to move out of the stack).
      - As a red-green pair (especially the pair that snaps their tether first), not waiting long enough for all [s:twice-come-ruin]s to expire and inflicting [s:doom]. (Not every [s:twice-come-ruin] has the same duration.)
      - As the red-green pair that snaps their tether last, snapping it too late, thus causing it to snap on its own and wipe the party.
    strategies:
      delta-lpdu:
        name: LPDU Standard
        description: |
          At the start, red-green tethers go to Final Omega, blue tethers to Beetle Omega. For each colour of tether, one pair is closer to the center, the other closest to their Omega. If one pair has a healer and the other doesn't, the healer pair prioritizes the center arena spot.
          For blue tethers, the pair closest to Beetle Omega keeps their tether **short**. The pair closer to the center keeps their tether **long**. The idea is to have this blue tether snap instantly once the tethers become active.
          The two pairs closest to the center each watch the other tether player they're closest to. When fists spawn, each center tether player compares their fist with that outer tether player's fist. If their fists match colours, the center pair switches positions.
          The red-green tether players can stack on their markers immediately. The blue tether players will not stack; instead the center pair waits until their tether becomes active and snaps, then collapses onto the other pair. These players must make sure they're fast about it; if they're not standing still when fists snapshot, the party wipes.
          If all fists were handled correctly, the blue tether pair that still has their tether as well as the red-green tether pair closer to the edge move out to bait the closest two Arm Units, thus snapping their tether. The blue tether pair whose tether already snapped move towards the center to bait [a:beyond-defense]. The red-green tether pair that was closer to the center bait the sidemost Arm Units.
          After telegraphs appear, both pairs of red-green tethers move close to the sidemost edges to bait [a:oversampled-wave-cannon]. The red-green pair that baited the sidemost Arm Units moves closer to the Beetle side, while the other pair stays on the Final Omega side.
          As for the (former) blue tethers: each of them, **except for the player hit by [a:beyond-defense]** stacks close to the center on the **non-monitor side**. The [a:beyond-defense] player moves away from the stack towards either Beetle or Final Omega, but **has to make sure they stay vertically aligned with the stack** so as to not accidentally bait a monitor.
          One random blue tether player will receive [s:oversampled-wave-cannon-loading]. This player must be at the front of the stack, facing away from the center. Be aware that this player may be the [a:beyond-defense] player, in which case they will still move out as before but also have to face the correct direction.
          If all mechanics properly resolve, watch Beetle Omega for the shining blue lights that appear on either side of it. Set up for [a:hello-near-distant-world] on the **other** side in the following way:
          * The two blue tether players without anything go to the edge, lining themselves up with the center of the 2/3 marker.
          * The blue tether player with [s:hello-near-world] lines themselves up with the B/D marker, directly in front of Omega's cleave.
          * The blue tether player with [s:hello-distant-world] lines themselves up with the B/D marker at the edge of the arena.
          * The red-green tether pair that baited the sidemost Arm Units **wait for [s:twice-come-ruin] to expire on all players**, then collapse onto each other on the safe side to snap their tether and line themselves up with the 1/4 marker – one player directly in front of Omega's cleave, the other in the center of the marker.
          * The red-green tether pair that baited the Arm Units closer to Final Omega rotate clockwise such that one player ends up directly underneath Beetle Omega, and the other player opposite. Both should stand directly in front of the cleave.
          After all [a:hello-near-distant-world] jumps resolve, the last remaining red-green tether pair must snap their tether, but they **must wait for all [s:twice-come-ruin] to expire first**.

      [s:hello-near-world] and [s:hello-distant-world] both resolve, causing those players to explode in large AoEs that wipe the raid if any other player is clipped, and inflicting [s:magic-vuln] and a stack of [s:quickening-dynamis] to them. [s:hello-near-world] then jumps to the closest player via a smaller AoE and [s:hello-distant-world] to the farthest player, inflicting the same statuses, then each jump one last time.
      Each set of [s:hello-near-world]/[s:hello-distant-world] therefore applies 6 stacks of [s:quickening-dynamis] to players. In total, Phase 5 features 4 sets of [a:hello-near-distant-world], adding up to 24 stacks throughout the whole phase. By the end of the phase each player must have [s:quickening-dynamis:3] or a wipe is guaranteed in Phase 6. This means that no stacks may be wasted (by having a jump go to a player who already has [s:quickening-dynamis:3]).
      Since any player can only accumulate one stack of [s:quickening-dynamis] per [a:hello-near-distant-world] set without dying, this also means that each player has to "sit out" 1 of the 4 sets and avoid being targeted by a jump.

      Heavy raidwide that initiates the second of three [trios](t:trio).
      Also inflicts one player with [s:hello-near-world] and another player with [s:hello-distant-world].
      **Proteans**
      Omega-M goes untargetable and two Right Arm Units appear. Unlike the units in [a:run-dynamis-(delta-version)], these units draw a visual tether toward the farthest player and, at the end of the mechanic, shoot a laser at these players. The tether isn't fixed; it dynamically changes its target based on who is farthest from the arm at any given point in time.
      After the arms appear, Omega-M reappears opposite the arms. Each player is also inflicted with [s:mid-glitch] or [s:remote-glitch] and assigned a PlayStation symbol ([i:cross][i:square][i:circle][i:triangle]). Same as [a:party-synergy], same-symbol players are tethered together.
      Shortly after, Final Omega spawns in the center of the arena and begins casting [a:wave-cannon-marked] as 6 players receive a red headmarker on top of them with 2 players remaining unmarked. The 2 unmarked players will never be paired with each other. At the end of the cast, [a:wave-cannon-marked] fires a cone at each marked player and the two arms fire [a:far-hyper-pulse] at the two farthest players. Both of these inflict [s:magic-vuln].
      **Towers**
      After [a:wave-cannon-marked] resolves, towers appear. The towers spawn in different configurations depending on if it's [s:remote-glitch] or [s:mid-glitch], but otherwise they always spawn in the same configuration. They may, however, be rotated: if wherever Omega-M spawned at the beginning of the mechanic is considered "relative north", then the towers always spawn either north-relative or south-relative.
      Before the towers explode, Omega-F appears in the center and casts [a:discharger], knocking players back. As [s:remote-glitch]/[s:mid-glitch] is still active here, players must be knocked into a tower away from their tether partner.
      Note that all players are required to resolve the towers.
      **Hello World**
      Omega's Rear Power Unit (the ring) spawns in the center of the arena, shows a rotation indicator, and prepares to cast [a:rear-lasers]. At the same time, Omega-F spawns in-line with the Rear Power Unit and prepares to cast either [a:superliminal-steel] or [a:optimized-blizzard-iii]. Finally, the Right Arm Units from the first part of this mechanic return, but this time they're placed in the wall on the far side of Omega-F.
      [a:rear-lasers] begins rotating, then [a:superliminal-steel]/[a:optimized-blizzard-iii] resolves while [a:rear-lasers] are still rotating, then [a:hello-near-far-world] and [a:far-hyper-pulse] resolve at the same time after [a:rear-lasers] have stopped firing.
    resolve: |
      As soon as the PlayStation symbols appear, the party should establish a 2-column [t:conga line] somewhere in the arena. It's common to line up in front of Omega-M. Don't line up in the center, as Final Omega's model will make it impossible to see the subsequent markers.
      Once markers appear, place the 2 unmarked players on the cardinals or intercardinals opposite the arms and the other 6 players on the other 6 cardinals or intercardinals. Each player should be opposite their tether partner. If it's [s:remote-glitch], all players should stand on the wall. If it's [s:mid-glitch], all players should stand on the fourth ring on the floor from the center of the arena.
      Most PF strategies designate fixed positions based on your initial position in the [t:conga line]. The diagram shows these positions for LPDU. After the spreads resolve, remember the marker you spread on and face your camera back towards Omega-M (or opposite him). That way, when towers spawn, you'll already be looking at either the northmost or southmost tower(s), and there is no chance of getting turned around. Most strategies designate towers based on the marker you spread on. Again, the diagram shows the LPDU designations.
      Wait on any of the center rings to be knocked back to your tower, then either stand in the center of the tower ([s:mid-glitch]) or on the far edge of the tower ([s:remote-glitch]).
      After towers resolve, assign Hello World spots, then find Omega-F. Go towards her if you're one of the Rear Arm Unit baiters or the first [a:hello-distant-world] target. Everyone else goes opposite Omega-F. Check which direction the [a:rear-lasers] rotate and move slightly towards the other direction to avoid being in the immediate path of the lasers.
      Take another look at Omega-F; check whether she's holding a staff or her legs are blades. If it's the former, **do not follow** the rotating laser until she executes [a:optimized-blizzard-iii], otherwise follow the laser.
      Lastly, move to [a:hello-near-distant-world] spots, taking care to avoid being in the path of the Rear Arm Units. Check the diagram for how LPDU handles this [a:hello-near-distant-world].
    mistakes:
      - Forgetting the marker you initially spread on or otherwise forgetting which tower that correlates to.
      - Not fixing your camera on the relative north/south, thus getting turned around and choosing the wrong tower.
      - As the two players designated for [a:far-hyper-pulse], not properly prepositioning or otherwise failing to communicate which arm each one takes.
      - As the second player to be hit by [a:hello-near-world], seeing that the other player is behind you and deciding to take their spot instead. (There is enough time for someone to make it to their spot if they move on the edge, even if they're slightly late, but due to how slowly player movement updates on other players' screens, there is not enough time to respond to someone else taking their spot.)

          * The first single-marked pair goes northeast (unmarked) and southwest (marked).
          * The second single-marked pair goes northwest (unmarked) and southeast (marked).
          The waymark you are on at this point determines your tower. "North", in this case, will either be where Omega-M spawned or directly opposite. To identify which it is, look at relative north and south and find the spot that has one tower (Remote Glitch) or two towers (Mid Glitch).
          * Waymark 1 takes the northwest tower, waymark 2 the northeast tower (Mid Glitch). In Far Glitch, waymarks 1 and 2 take the northmost tower.
          * Waymark 3 takes the southwest 2-person tower, waymark 4 the southeast 2-person tower.
          * Waymarks A–D take the southern towers, with A taking the westmost tower and D taking the eastmost tower.

      A player cannot be inflicted with both [s:first-in-line] and [s:second-in-line] at the same time.
      **AoEs**
      Final Omega spawns in the center of the arena along with a clone of Omega-M and Omega-F to either side of him. Similar to [a:party-synergy], these clones are either equipped with a sword or shield, or a staff or blade legs respectively, and prepare to execute a combination of [a:efficient-bladework]/[a:beyond-strength] and [a:optimized-blizzard-iii]/[a:superliminal-steel].
      Then, a second set of Omega-F and Omega-M clones spawns perpendicular to the first ones, who also prepare to execute a combination of the above AoEs.
      Final Omega either doesn't change the rotation of its ring or turns it sidewards and begins to cast [a:diffuse-wave-cannon] as the ring starts to glow. At the end of the cast, [a:diffuse-wave-cannon] shoots two massive conal AoEs towards either side of the ring, with only the ring's sides remaining safe. In addition, the first set of clones' AoEs resolves here.
      After a brief delay, Final Omega's ring **rotates by 90°** and executes [a:diffuse-wave-cannon] again. The second set of clones' AoEs resolves here.
      Note that the clones **always spawn on intercardinals** while the ring can **only face cardinals**.
      Also note that Omega-F **remains targetable** for the entire duration of this part of the mechanic.
      **Hello World, Part 1**
      Omega-F disappears and Final Omega prepares to cast [a:oversampled-wave-cannon] with monitors pointing to either the east or west side of the arena. The first set of [a:hello-near-distant-world] resolves at the same time as [a:oversampled-wave-cannon].
      **Hello World, Part 2**
      Final Omega disappears and Beetle Omega spawns on either the east or west side of the arena, and prepares to cast [a:blaster] with two tethers spawning on random players. The second set of [a:hello-near-distant-world] resolves just after [a:blaster].
    resolve: |
      **Keep track of whichever set of clones spawns first** and visualize the safe spot. Unless you have brain power to spare, ignore the other set of clones for now.
      Wait for Final Omega to begin casting [a:diffuse-wave-cannon]. **Don't move into the safe spot before this**, as Final Omega may rotate its ring at this time, thus changing the safe spot. After moving into the first safe spot, look at the next set of clones and visualize *their* safe spot.
      After the first set of AoEs resolves, either move about **90° counter-clockwise or 90° clockwise** into the next safe spot. **Do not stay or move across the arena** as Final Omega is **guaranteed** to rotate its ring by 90° here.
      If you've handled P5 correctly up until now, there should be 4 players with [s:quickening-dynamis:2] and 4 players with [s:quickening-dynamis:1] in your party at this time. Randomly choose 2 of the [s:quickening-dynamis:2] players to bait [a:oversampled-wave-cannon]. All other players should receive another stack, thus giving you 6 players with [s:quickening-dynamis:2] and 2 players with [s:quickening-dynamis:3]. The 2 players with [s:quickening-dynamis:3] must take care of the subsequent [a:blaster] tethers.
      If executed correctly, everyone should now have [s:quickening-dynamis:3], paving the way for Phase 6.
      If anyone doesn't have [s:quickening-dynamis:3] at this point you are guaranteed to wipe early into Phase 6, so it's recommended to wipe the pull immediately.
    tips:
      - It's recommended to use most of your remaining party mitigation after the initial cast of [a:run-dynamis-(omega-version)]. This will allow players (even non-tanks) to survive a hit during the first part of the mechanic, thus keeping the pull alive (though the player will be inflicted with [s:2911]). If this happens, it is **strongly recommended** to [t:wall] yourself at the earliest opportunity to get rid of [s:2911]. The [a:blind-faith] DPS check may not be possible to beat otherwise. Make absolutely sure to only wall yourself if a) you do **not** have [s:hello-near-world] or [s:hello-distant-world] and the first set of [a:hello-near-distant-world] has finished executing, or b) the second set of [a:hello-near-distant-world] has finished executing. In other words, do not wall yourself if you have a mechanical responsibility in the next 10 seconds.
      - "Generally, you can categorize each dodge into one of three categories: a close dodge ([a:superliminal-steel] + [a:beyond-strength]/[a:efficient-bladework]), a mid dodge ([a:optimized-blizzard-iii] + [a:beyond-strength]), and a far dodge ([a:optimized-blizzard-iii] + [a:efficient-bladework]). As the main condition for which type of dodge it is lies in Omega-F's attack, it is her stance that you should identify first. If she has blade legs, you already know it'll be a close dodge. Otherwise, check Omega-M to determine whether it's a mid or a far dodge."
    mistakes:
      - Not reading Omega-F's or Omega-M's stance correctly.
      - "When Final Omega's ring is facing north/south: aligning yourself with the edge of the ring rather than the arena markers. (When Omega's ring faces north/south, the ring is offset from the center of Omega's hitbox and **cannot** be used to align yourself with its cones.)"
      - "[a:oversampled-wave-cannon] players standing too close to the [a:hello-near-distant-world] players and vice-versa. It is recommended to stand at the edge of the arena as a monitor player."
      - "[a:blaster] tether players standing too close to the [a:hello-near-distant-world] players and vice-versa. It is recommended to stand at the edge of the arena as a tethered player."

      Heavy raidwide. Wipes the party unless a [i:tank] LB3 is used.
      Upgrades [s:quickening-dynamis:3] into [s:brilliant-dynamis] and gives [boss] [s:code-dynamis].
      Due to [s:brilliant-dynamis]'s (and [s:spark-of-dynamis]'s) damage resistance, it is required for all 8 players to have this buff at this point. If any players missed a stack of [s:quickening-dynamis] in Phase 5, it is no longer possible to finish the fight.
      [s:brilliant-dynamis] also gives a player the ability to use a limit break for free once the limit break bar is filled. Mechanically this phase requires:
      * 3× [i:tank] LB3 ([a:cosmo-memory-2] and [a:magic-number])
      * 2× [i:healer] LB3 ([a:magic-number])
      * 1× [i:caster] LB3 and 1× [i:pranged] LB3 ([a:cosmo-meteor])
      This leaves 3 possible [i:melee] LB3s for a total of 10 available limit breaks during this phase. As of patch 6.5, it is possible to skip one [i:melee] LB3 if your damage is good, but the others cannot currently be skipped as the DPS check is designed with 3 [i:melee] LB3s in mind.
      Other things to know include:
      * The [auto attacks](a:flash-gale) in this phase target the main target and the *farthest* target. [boss] always executes 2 auto-attacks in-between major mechanics, so after each major mechanic, it is essential that the party steps into the hitbox and the off-tank outside.
      * Due to the strict LB requirements, a non-standard [i:dps] composition (i.e. a party that is not composed of [i:melee][i:melee][i:caster][i:pranged]) cannot finish the fight. Unlike DSR, you *can* finish the fight with only 1 healer or even 0 healers though, provided you bring sufficient DPS.
      * **Any death before [a:cosmo-meteor] is an automatic wipe** as that player loses their [s:brilliant-dynamis]/[s:spark-of-dynamis], meaning that even if raised they will just die again to the next damage instance. The only time players are allowed to die is to the last hit(s) of [a:cosmo-meteor], and only if they're a [i:dps], otherwise they'll lose their free LB3 (but only supports should still have any LB3s left here).

      [boss] fires up arrows that come down in two fixed shapes: a cross-shaped AoE in the middle, and lines around the outside of the arena. Which of these shapes impacts first depends on which of the two is telegraphed first.
      After the arrows come down, square-shaped AoEs that are half the width of the initial AoEs begin to travel outwards (for the cross) and inwards (for the outside lines).
      Note that there is no guarantee you'll see both patterns within a pull. You may only get the cross-first pattern both times the ability is used in this phase, or vice-versa.
    resolve: |
      Determine which of the two patterns is used. Generally, these are the accepted dodge strategies (though other dodges are possible), with each comma indicating one hit of the AoEs:
      * **cross first**: in, stay, out, stay, sides, in.
      * **outer first**: out, stay, in, sides, in.
      For "sides", the cardinal edges of [boss]'s hitbox are safe. Check the diagrams for a better idea of where to stand.
      For the first [a:cosmo-arrow], have both tanks dodge from separate starting positions, and have the rest of the party dodge from the same starting position. This way everyone will already be in position for [a:cosmo-dive] at the end.
      For the second [a:cosmo-arrow], have 2 players per starting position and dodge towards opposite sides during the "sides" step of the dodge. See the diagram for an illustration. Doing this will automatically have every player spread for [a:cosmo-wave-cannon].

      A circle with arrows appears on a random cardinal or intercardinal about half a second before the end of the cast. Three more circles then appear clockwise or counter-clockwise, each with a slight delay.
      Five seconds after the cast, big telegraphed AoEs spawn underneath each party member that resolve 2.7 seconds later. They do not follow players. More AoEs spawn underneath each party member every 2 seconds. At the same time, the first of the arrow circles on the outside of the arena resolves into exaflares that travel across the arena in the indicated direction, then the next, and so on.
    resolve: |
      Stack in the center of the arena with the entire party. During the cast, continuously turn your camera until you've found the location of the first exaflare. Once the cast finishes and the first set of AoEs appears underneath players, move toward the marker next to the first exaflare that does *not* have another exaflare on top of it, then move into where the first exaflare was, and continue to move around the hitbox at max melee until you're clear.
      Just like [a:pantokrator], don't move too far ahead – only move just outside the previous set of baited AoEs until the next set of baited AoEs appears.

      A short while later, spawns eight adds around the hitbox: 6× Cosmo Comet and 2× Cosmo Meteor. The meteors always spawn north and south while the remaining ones spawn on the other cardinals and intercardinals. If not killed within 15 seconds, they will wipe the party.
      At the same time, hits 4 party members with [targeted spreads](a:cosmo-meteor-spreads), then the other 4.
      There is a second round of spreads that functions the same as the first, then 3 players are targeted by [flare markers](a:cosmo-meteor-flare). At the same time as the flares resolve, a random non-flare player is targeted with a [stack](a:cosmo-meteor-stack) that is lethal if taken with less than 5 players.
    resolve: |
      At the start of the cast, everyone should stack dead-center of [boss]'s hitbox. Wait until the AoEs appear, then everyone moves out to their designated clock spot.
      Note that your [i:pranged] player must be either north or south (in line with the Cosmo Meteors), so if your main [i:tank]'s usual clock spot is north, have them swap with the [i:pranged] for this mechanic.
      As soon as the comets are targetable, have your [i:caster] use their limit break 3, which will destroy all Cosmo Comets and leave only the Cosmo Meteors alive. You cannot DPS these adds manually; if you do, you'll be sacrificing boss DPS and will hit enrage.
      Use all your remaining party mitigation before the first round of spreads, heal between the two rounds of spreads.
      Once the [i:caster] limit break has finished, have your [i:pranged] use their limit break to destroy the remaining 2 Cosmo Meteors.
      Flares will appear here. One of them should go north or south while the other two should go east and west. The party should stack on whichever clock spot belongs to the [i:pranged] during this mechanic (either north or south).
      **Be aware that your [i:pranged] will be casting their limit break during this part, so they'll be utterly immobile. If they're a flare, the party must therefore adjust and stack on the opposite clock spot, as the [i:pranged] player cannot move away.**

      Note that [a:cover] *prevents* the targeted player from being inflicted with [s:magic-number]. This can be used to essentially "skip" one [a:magic-number] if one of your healers has died and lost their free LB3. (Have the non-PLD use [i:tank] LB3 while the PLD [a:cover]s the healer who still has [s:brilliant-dynamis], then have the PLD click off their LB3 buff immediately to ensure they die to the cast without having to wait for [s:magic-number] to expire. The healer raises the PLD, the PLD uses [i:tank] LB3 and the healer uses [i:healer] LB3 to raise the rest of the party.)
    trivia: |
      In programming terms, a *magic number* is a number that is used directly in source code. This is an anti-pattern; best practice is to extract such numbers into named constants and then reference the constant anywhere the number is needed. This way the name of that constant explains what the number means.
      For instance, if you saw an expression like "8 × 8760", you'd probably have no idea what this expression calculates. However, if you instead rewrite it as "8 × HOURS_PER_YEAR", now you know exactly that this expression calculates the number of hours in 8 years.

      If the first [i:melee] LB3 is late, the second [i:melee] player must make sure to preposition in the center before using their limit break, as they'll be in animation lock as the [a:cosmo-meteor] baits appear.
