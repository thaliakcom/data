      Reduces all damage dealt by 90%.
      Due to the extremely punishing nature of the damage reduction and the long duration of this debuff, it is recommended to [wall](t:wall) yourself at the earliest convenience where no mechanics require your input to replace [s:damage-down] with [s:weakness], which only has a 100s duration and only reduces damage by 25%.
      Under no circumstances should you use any kind of damage cooldown while [s:damage-down] is active, even during the 2m buff window. Raid buffs are the only exception, since they are unaffected by the damage reduction.
      Inflicted by many mechanics, including [a:unmitigated-explosion].

      Like [s:damage-down], reduces damage dealt by 90% for 3 minutes. In addition, accumulating :unverified(another stack) of this debuff instantly kills the player.
      In Futures Rewritten (Ultimate), this debuff is inflicted on all players inside a [m:stack.healers] if an incorrect number of players (either too many or too few) soaked the stack.

    description: |
      Fatebreaker surrounds himself with an aura of either fire or lightning, then disappears as the arena becomes wreathed in fog.
      A Fatebreaker's Image spawns at the edge of every cardinal and intercardinal. They can only be seen by players close to them. Three of those Images *raise* their sword and begin casting [a:blasting-zone], a wide [ms:line] AoE covering the entire cardinal or intercardinal. The other Images remain inactive.
      [Blasting zones](a:blasting-zone) can never completely overlap. In other words: if an Image casts [a:blasting-zone], it is not possible for the Image across to also cast [a:blasting-zone].
      In addition, when [a:blasting-zone] resolves Fatebreaker also executes the following mechanic:
      * If he was channeling fire (red) during the initial Utopian Sky cast, both healers are targeted by [a:sinbound-fire-iii], a [m:stack.supports].
      * If he was channeling lightning (blue) during the initial Utopian Sky cast, all players are targeted by [a:sinbound-thunder-iii], a [m:spread].
    resolve: |
      Designate a [t:protean] for every player and have every player move to the edge of their protean position after the Utopian Sky cast, but ensure that **both tanks take adjacent protean positions** to resolve [s:powder-mark-trail]. They must also use heavy mitigation here.
      Have each player look at their clone. If the clone is raising its sword, or if the **player across from them** moves forward, the player also moves forward. If done correctly, there must now be two players who haven't moved from their initial protean position at the edge of the arena. Those two positions, and only those two positions, are **safe** from [a:blasting-zone].
      To resolve [a:sinbound-fire-iii]/[a:sinbound-thunder-iii], both safe spots must contain at most 4 players and at most 1 healer. In accordance, separate your group into 2 light parties and move each light party into one safe spot. If [a:sinbound-fire-iii] is stocked, no further action needs to be taken; just ensure all 4 players are in the safe spot. If [a:sinbound-thunder-iii] is stocked, players must spread within the safe spot in a triangle formation.
