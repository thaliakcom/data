  # All Phases
  damage-down:
    id: 2911
    type: impairment
    duration: 180000
    description: |
      Reduces all damage dealt by 90%.
      Due to the extremely punishing nature of the damage reduction and the long duration of this debuff, it is recommended to [wall](t:wall) yourself at the earliest convenience where no mechanics require your input to replace [s:damage-down] with [s:weakness], which only has a 100s duration and only reduces damage by 25%.
      Under no circumstances should you use any kind of damage cooldown while [s:damage-down] is active, even during the 2m buff window. Raid buffs are the only exception, since they are unaffected by the damage reduction.
      Note that this debuff stacks with [s:mark-of-mortality], reducing damage dealt by a total of 99% if a player holds both debuffs at the same time.

  magic-vulnerability-up:

    type: vuln
    duration: [1960, 3950]
    description: Renders magic damage lethal. Prevents any one player from resolving multiple mechanics simultaneously.
  mark-of-mortality:
    id: 4372
    type: impairment
    duration: 180000
    description: |
      Like [s:damage-down], reduces damage dealt by 90% for 3 minutes. In addition, being inflicted with another stack of this debuff instantly kills the player.
      In Futures Rewritten (Ultimate), this debuff is inflicted on all players inside some [m:stack.healers] if too few players soaked the stack.
      Unlike [s:twice-come-ruin], being inflicted with another stack of this debuff does *not* turn the debuff into [s:doom]. Instead, the afflicted player simply dies with no delay.

    duration: 15000
    description: |
      Inflicted on 2 players during [a:turn-of-the-heavens]. If these two players die by any means before their stack resolves their burn mark explodes, instantly killing all party members.
  floating-fetters:
    id: 2304
    type: impairment
    duration: 3950
    description: |
      The player is lifted up into the air and enclosed within a bubble that prevents movement.
      Note that the bubble cannot be placed within the hitbox of the Fatebreaker who creates it, since this would make that Fatebreaker unable to dash to his target. If the player is within Fatebreaker's hitbox when [s:floating-fetters] is inflicted, that player is displaced to the edge of the boss's hitbox. If the player is currently casting, this will interrupt their cast. This is only relevant for the first tether during [a:fall-of-faith]. All subsequent bubbles can be placed within Fatebreaker's hitbox.
      Inflicted by [a:floating-fetters], which is used during [a:fall-of-faith].

    description: |
      [t:protean:c] [m:spread]s into [m:stack.partner] or [m:spread], depending on the element Fatebreaker channels.
      * If Fatebreaker is channeling fire (red), it's [m:spread] into [m:stack.partner] ([a:sinsmoke]).
      * If Fatebreaker is channeling lightning (blue), it's [m:spread] into [m:spread] ([a:sinsmite]).
      This is followed by avoidable conal AoEs on wherever the players stood when they took [a:cyclonic-break-proteans]. The spread/stack resolves during the first set of baited AoEs. There are 2 more sets afterwards in intervals of 2 seconds. After the first set, the conal AoEs always rotate by exactly 22.5° before the next set.
    resolve: |
      1. Spread in [t:protean] positions while paying attention to Fatebreaker's colour.
      2. Move into the space in-between the markers – if you're a DPS, move clockwise, otherwise counter-clockwise. If it's blue and you're a ranged player, move out as well (a more diagonal movement).
      3. Move into the baited cones after they resolve and repeat this step 2 more times.
    tips:
      - You can rotate counter-clockwise as well; just make sure everyone rotates the same way or there will likely be collisions.
      - Contrary to popular belief, the baited AoEs **are not** baited during every set. Only the **first** set is baited by players; each subsequent set simply rotates clockwise by 22.5°, which means that positioning yourself precisely on your protean position only matters during the initial protean spreads.

      The only real purpose of this ability is to deal damage to and inflict [s:magic-vulnerability-up] on any [blue-fettered](s:floating-fetters) players, since [a:bow-shock] only hits the 3 closest players and not the fettered player themselves.

    mechanic: mech
    description: |
      Fatebreaker surrounds himself with an aura of either fire or lightning, then disappears as the arena becomes wreathed in fog.
      A Fatebreaker's Image spawns at the edge of every cardinal and intercardinal. They can only be seen by players close to them. Three of those Images *raise* their sword and begin casting [a:blasting-zone], a wide [ms:line] AoE covering the entire cardinal or intercardinal. The other Images remain inactive.
      [Blasting Zones](a:blasting-zone) can never completely overlap. In other words: if an Image casts [a:blasting-zone], it is not possible for the Image across to also cast [a:blasting-zone].
      In addition, when [a:blasting-zone] resolves Fatebreaker also executes the following mechanic:
      * If he was channeling fire (red) during the initial Utopian Sky cast, both healers are targeted by [a:sinbound-fire-iii], a [m:stack.supports].
      * If he was channeling lightning (blue) during the initial Utopian Sky cast, all players are targeted by [a:sinbound-thunder-iii], a [m:spread].
    resolve: |
      Designate a [t:protean] for every player and have every player move to the edge of their protean position after the Utopian Sky cast, but ensure that **both tanks take adjacent protean positions** to resolve [s:powder-mark-trail]. They must also use heavy mitigation here.
      Have each player look at their clone. If the clone is raising its sword, or if the **player across from them** moves forward, the player also moves forward. If done correctly, there must now be two players who haven't moved from their initial protean position at the edge of the arena. Those two positions, and only those two positions, are **safe** from [a:blasting-zone].
      To resolve [a:sinbound-fire-iii]/[a:sinbound-thunder-iii], both safe spots must contain at most 4 players and at most 1 healer. In accordance, separate your group into 2 light parties and move each light party into one safe spot. If [a:sinbound-fire-iii] is stocked, no further action needs to be taken; just ensure all 4 players are in the safe spot. If [a:sinbound-thunder-iii] is stocked, players must spread within the safe spot in a triangle formation.
      **Note**: Both tanks **must** be assigned *adjacent* protean positions for this mechanic, otherwise a non-tank will be hit by [a:burn-mark].

      Several things happen in succession.
      * A Fatebreaker's Image spawns on the west of the arena and begins casting [a:burnt-strike-lightning] through the middle of the arena.
      * Fatebreaker's Image near the center of the arena channels either fire or lightning as he casts Turn of the Heavens. At the end of the cast he disappears.
      * Blue and red circles appear at every cardinal and intercardinal. All circles from north to southwest are one colour, and the 4 remaining circles are the other colour.
      * One Fatebreaker's Image spawns north of the arena and begins casting [a:burnt-strike-fire] through the middle of the arena.
      * Two Fatebreaker's Images spawn outside the arena and cast [a:bound-of-faith]. They tether to two random players and inflict [s:prey] and [s:fated-burn-mark] on them.
      * The [a:burnt-strike-lightning] resolves.
      * The [a:burnt-strike-fire] resolves 6 seconds later.
      * All circles explode ([a:brightfire]), dealing massive damage and inflicting [s:damage-down] on all players inside them. The circles **matching** the center clone's colour during the Turn of the Heavens cast expand before they explode.
      * The two tether clones [charge](a:solemn-charge) towards the two tethered players and hit them with a 4-man stack ([a:sinsmoke-tether]).
    resolve: |
      1. Check the colour of the center clone and remember it for later. (Alternatively, remember the *opposite* colour, if you prefer going *to* the colour you remember instead of away from it.)
      2. Get out of the middle of the arena. Group 1 moves north, group 2 south. (Alternatively, you can simply move to the side closest after your [a:cyclonic-break] dodge and stay there for now, but this may make adjusts more difficult later.)
      3. Find the side that has the circles *not* matching the colour of the central clone. This is either east or west. Move toward that side.
      4. Position yourself in light parties for the knockback.
      5. While waiting for the knockback (or earlier), check if an adjust is necessary. Both groups must contain exactly 4 players, and only one of those 4 may have a tether. The general adjust priority is TMRH, meaning that tanks adjust most of the time and healers never adjust.
      6. Get knocked back into one of the gaps between the circles. Move back into middle through those gaps.
      7. Stop moving once the tethered player in your group is inflicted with [s:floating-fetters] and wait for the stack to resolve.

      Three towers appear in a line on either the west or east of the arena. Each tower requires between one to four players inside it when it resolves, always totaling up to six players. If less players than required occupy the tower, triggers [a:unmitigated-explosion], dealing massive damage and inflicting [s:damage-down] on all players.
    resolve: |
      The easiest way to resolve this mechanic is by assigning one "fixed" player to each tower, from north to south. This player will always take that tower no matter what. Then assign one more player to each tower. This player adjusts to a different tower if their tower is a one-person tower.
      The adjust is quite simple: check if your tower is a 1-person tower. If it is, find the tower that requires three or four players. There can never be more than one tower that requires more than two players, so no priority system is necessary for this mechanic.
      Make sure to pay attention to the [a:burnt-strike] that happens right before the towers resolve. If it's blue, go to your tower immediately; otherwise get knocked into your tower.
      Tanks never take towers, as their [s:powder-mark-trail] resolves at the same time as the towers do.

      Deals heavy raidwide damage and begins a complex trio-like mechanic.
      The mechanic begins with four simultaneous elements:
      * Usurper of Frost disappears from the arena.
      * Oracle's Reflection shouts "Cleave!" or "Reap!" and begins casting either [a:axe-kick] or [a:scythe-kick], respectively. She is always positioned in the center of the arena.
      * Two big [a:icicle-impact] AoEs appear on two random opposite [principals](t:principal) of the arena.
      * Either all supports or all damage dealers are targeted by [a:frigid-stone].
      Shortly afterwards, four more [a:icicle-impact]s appear next to the two existing ones, followed by a last set in the two remaining safe spots.
      [a:axe-kick]/[a:scythe-kick] resolves at approximately the same time as [a:the-house-of-light], which targets the four *closest* players with conal AoEs that inflict [s:magic-vulnerability-up]. The first set of [a:icicle-impact] resolves shortly after, followed by [a:frigid-stone]. [a:frigid-stone] also inflicts [s:magic-vulnerability-up] and leaves behind star-shaped AoEs in the form of [a:frigid-needle].
      Next, Oracle's Reflection teleports to a random [t:principal] and Usurper of Frost takes her place, executing [a:heavenly-strike], knocking players back a moderate distance. At the same time, Oracle's Reflection begins casting [a:sinbound-holy], an untelegraphed [m:stack.healers] on both healers that hits four times in a row, with each hit leaving behind a puddle that inflicts a lethal [s:bleeding-puddle] if players linger within for too long. The first hit roughly coincides with [a:frigid-needle] resolving. Usurper of Frost also moves to a random [t:principal] at this point, but while Oracle's Reflection is on the *inside* of the arena, Usurper of Frost teleports *outside* of the arena.
      After all 4 hits of [a:sinbound-holy] are done, both Oracle's Reflection and Usurper of Frost change, with Oracle's Reflection changing into [a:frost-armor] while Usurper of Frost changes into [a:shining-armor]. Both of these outfit changes are [m:mech.gaze] attacks, [stunning](s:stun) players who face either boss when they finish. It also turns the arena to ice, inflicting [s:thin-ice] on all players.
      If any player is [stunned](s:stun), they are guaranteed to die without [a:rescue] intervention, as Oracle's Reflection (now appearing as the Usurper of Frost originally did) shouts "In stillness freeze!" or "Sink into silence!" and begins casting either [a:twin-stillness] or [a:twin-silence], respectively, a two-step attack that requires movement in-between the two hits to avoid the attack.
    resolve: |
      Starting off, it is strongly recommended for all players to preposition on standard [t:protean] positions, with supports on cardinals and damage dealers on intercardinals (or vice-versa). The goal of the first part of this mechanic is to ensure that all [a:frigid-needle]s are placed adjacent to the first set of [a:icicle-impact]. This is because the first [a:icicle-impact] locations are the two target [t:principal]s for the [a:heavenly-strike] knockback, and placing the [a:frigid-needle] next to those principals renders them safe.
      To accomplish this, it is recommended to use [t:color partners]. At the start of the mechanic, when players are selected by [a:frigid-stone], check 1) whether the boss is casting [a:axe-kick] ("Cleave!") or [a:scythe-kick] ("Reap!"), 2) where the first [a:icicle-impact]s spawned, and 3) whether you were selected by [a:frigid-stone] or not. If you've been selected by [a:frigid-stone] but you're *not* next to an [a:icicle-impact], switch positions with your color partner. The same goes if you've *not* been selected by [a:frigid-stone] but you're next to an [a:icicle-impact]. Do all this while either moving in our out (depending on [a:scythe-kick]/[a:axe-kick]).
      If you do *not* have a [a:frigid-stone] on you, make sure you're closer to the boss than the players that do, *regardless* of whether it's [a:scythe-kick] or [a:axe-kick].
      If it's [a:axe-kick], the non-[a:frigid-stone] players need to pay extra attention, as they may be standing within the first set of [a:icicle-impact]s. Gapclosers are recommended to quickly get out of its impact zone after taking your [a:the-house-of-light]. If you don't have a gapcloser, use the [a:scythe-kick] or [a:axe-kick] castbar as an indicator of when to move. *Do not wait for [a:the-house-of-light] to visually execute. This will be too late to escape the [a:icicle-impact]. Move the __instant__ the castbar fills.*
      If it's [a:scythe-kick], the [a:frigid-stone] players need to pay extra attention, as they'll need to stand on the edge of the [a:scythe-kick] AoE, then move out slightly after [a:scythe-kick] resolves to place their [a:frigid-stone]s on the inner circle of the arena. For [a:axe-kick], [a:frigid-stone]s should be placed on the edge of the arena.
      After placing [a:frigid-stone]s, players should split into light parties and get knocked back into where the first [a:icicle-impact]s were. Typically, group 1 wants to get knocked back on a red or purple marker and group 2 on a blue or yellow marker. If someone went to the wrong light party, don't panic, as a 3-stack is entirely survivable with proper healing and mitigation.
      [a:sinbound-holy] is a fairly simple mechanic: just keep moving in a group. There is one caveat, however – as each hit of the multi-stack leaves behind a puddle that instantly kills any who enter, it is essential not to place any puddles aside from the first directly behind Oracle's Reflection, as this would place a puddle in the only safe spot for the subsequent [a:twin-stillness]/[a:twin-silence]. To accomplish this, the generally accepted strategy is to always move **clockwise**, *unless* Oracle's Reflection is positioned 45° clockwise from the initial knockback position. Do not move through the center of the arena under any circumstances, as the resulting puddles will obstruct the dodge path for [a:twin-stillness]/[a:twin-silence].
      After the 4 stack hits are done, move out of the last puddle and look away from both bosses. **Do not move** as this is the point where [s:thin-ice] will be inflicted, which will likely instantly kill any player who is moving at that moment. Find Oracle's Reflection (now clad in frost armour) and try to either slide to be directly *behind* or *opposite* her. Wait for her to cast [a:twin-stillness] or [a:twin-silence] (or listen to the voiceline; either approach works) and slide again – be in front of her if she casts [a:twin-silence] and behind her if she casts [a:twin-stillness]. After the end of the cast, slide across the arena to the opposite position. **The snapshot for this mechanic takes place significantly before the visual animation, so do not wait for the attack to visually hit before you slide.**

      A rotating laser originating from a Delight's Hourglass.
      Targets the closest player to the hourglass and fires one laser at them. After a two-second delay it fires 9 additional lasers in one-second intervals, each AoE slightly angled clockwise or counter-clockwise to the previous one. This direction is indicated by the standard rotation marker.
      Each laser deals moderate damage and inflicts [s:fire-resistance-down-ii], unless the player already suffers from [s:fire-resistance-down-ii], in which case the laser is lethal.

      Summons Fragment of Fate, a crystal containing Gaia's memories. Throughout this phase, this crystal takes several instances of unavoidable damage from Oracle of Darkness and Usurper of Frost, ultimately leaving it at 1 HP at the end of the phase.
      However, the crystal may also be hit by player-targeted mechanics, including spreads, stacks, and tankbusters. Since the unavoidable damage leaves the crystal at 1 HP at the end of the phase, if the crystal takes a single instance of avoidable damage, it is guaranteed to be destroyed. If the crystal is not alive by the end of Phase 4, Mitron successfully fuses with Loghrif to create Eden's Promise and cast [a:paradise-lost], wiping the party. Only if the crystal is still alive does the fusion fail, creating [boss] instead and allowing players to progress to Phase 5.
      Note that, if any Crystal of Dark was destroyed during Intermission, the Fragment still spawns but has reduced maximum HP, thus guaranteeing a wipe at the end of the phase.

    tips:
      - If more than one player is dead at the end of [a:akh-morn] or the bosses' HP is not balanced, it may be preferable to sacrifice the main target by letting them solo the stack.
